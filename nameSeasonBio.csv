His favorite movie is ""The Jerk"" and thatâs how some people just might describe him.

The fact that she is one of the older castaways will not be a hindrance for this woman who previously trained alongside Olympic athletes and still rises every morning at 4:30AM to get in her daily workout before tackling a day filled with hundreds of pubescent teens, pre-teens, parents, faculty and staff.  Not one to be intimidated (even at a tiny 5â2â), Debra juggles work, her husband and her children.

He currently works in real estate investment sales and enjoys spending his free time strumming his guitar, tossing around a football and hanging out with friends. He is definitely a man who takes pride in hard work and being a Texan.
 <br/><br/>
Joe truly is a genuine Texas Cowboy. After a rigorous selection process in combination with a high GPA from the University of Texas at Austin, he was selected to join the Texas Cowboys, which is a service organization where members act as ambassadors for, according to Joe, ""the greatest university in the world,"" the University of Texas. When he is not working or volunteering his time, Joe enjoys playing basketball and golf in addition to spending time working out and running. 
 <br/><br/>
He feels that he will be the next person to win SURVIVOR because he is dedicated, goal oriented and plans to use a strategy he calls ""persuade and evade."" He intends to constantly look for alliances and win challenges, all while staying just below the radar. He doesn't like overly dramatic people and hates to lose. Unfortunately he may be faced with both in his attempt to become the next sole SURVIVOR.

<br/><br/>
Soon to see his teenage years in the rear-view mirror, Spencer Duhm is ready to look forward to the journey ahead of him. A fan of SURVIVOR since day one, which began when he was still in grade school, Spencer can practically do a Castaway roll-call all the way from SURVIVOR: Borneo. His fanaticism will give him a built-in edge that can make a direct contribution to how far he goes in this game.
<br/><br/>
Born and raised in Lakeland, Florida and currently a student at the University of Florida, Spencer majors in telecommunications and minors in business and European union studies. Aside from being the recruitment chair for his UF crew team, where he also rows competitively, Spencer is a huge sports fan. Involved in myriad athletic activities since age 7, Spencer has developed a strong competitive streak and determination to achieve success. Rooting for his college Gators or beloved Cubs familiarized him with all of the peaks and valleys associated with being a contender, which may help him navigate the ups and downs associated with castaway life.
<br/><br/>
With a resume like his, itâs no surprise that this self-professed lover of ""water cooler gossip"" can't stand slow-talkers or laziness and is very  ambitious  and very outgoing. He is even willing to face his fear of heights for one million dollars but there is one fear that he refuses to face. When asked what he would not do for a million dollars he responded, ""Snakes in general, I just donât do snakes."" This young, goal-oriented man has been presented with his childhood dream of competing on his favorite reality show and truly feels that he has what it takes to become the next sole SURVIVOR .
 <br/><br/>
Spencer is a gay, single man and currently resides in Gainesville, Fla. His birthday is December 20.

Occupation: Bartender<br/>
<br/><br/>
Born in Panama, Carolina spent the first six years of her life living in poverty until her father, an Army solider, moved the family to the Untied States so he could have the opportunity to provide a better life for them.  Despite the adversity that Carolina has faced throughout her life, she has a positive outlook and views those difficulties as learning experiences that have pushed her to become the trash-talking firecracker and SURVIVOR of life that she is today.
<br/><br/>
Three years ago, with only $250 in her pocket, Carolina made the move from Florida to Los Angeles to accomplish personal goals and to fulfill her desire to help provide for her family. Life has not been easy for this California bartender but rather than succumbing to the negative pressures, she decided to face her inner demons and live life with a positive, compassionate outlook. 
<br/><br/>
Carolina describes the relationship with her mother as an emotional rollercoaster but admires the woman that was able to overcome adversity and become a self-sufficient mother of three.  Her mother has shown Carolina what dreams are made of by giving her a life that would have been impossible in Panama.
<br/><br/>
While her game strategy is still a work-in-progress, Carolina knows that the lessons learned from her life experiences have provided her with tools that may get her far in this game.  If she becomes the next sole SURVIVOR, Carolina plans to give back to her mother, help her brothers with school, and donate to various organizations that aid victims of rape and domestic violence.
<br/><br/>
In her free time she enjoys spending time with friends and participating in outdoor activities such as surfing, snowboarding and hiking with her dogs, Sandy and Zoe.

Stephen Fishbach believes he's a cutthroat player who can manipulate his way to SURVIVOR success, though you couldn't tell that by looking at his non-threatening appearance. The first one to tell you he resembles a Muppet, Stephen plans to sidetrack his competition with his goofy charm and quirky sense of humor.
<br/><br/>
Aided by his quick wit and prankster personality, this Internet marketing director could very well be a major player behind the scenes. A Yale graduate, Stephen certainly has the right mix of brains and charisma to disarm his fellow castaways. This New Yorker believes people will be inclined to trust him but claims ""that would be their mistake, because then I strike!""
<br/><br/>
Described by his friends as wild, smart and ambitious, Stephen's biggest pet peeve is when somebody is âoverconfident or cocky.â He plans to use that type of person to his advantage by forming a bond and then subtly prompting them to carry out his decisions. A strategist, Stephen prides himself on being able to pretend to agree with someone's idea while replacing it with his own.
<br/><br/>
In his free time, Stephen keeps himself active and fit by boxing and lifting weights. He also takes part in urban combat activities, namely the Idiotarod, which he describes as a great event where ""five idiots drag a shopping cart from Brooklyn to Manhattan."" Among his reasons for why he believes he will excel at SURVIVOR, Stephen lists ""he's strategic and devious.""

<br/><br/>
A GrammyÂ®-nominee for her soul group SWV (""Sisters With Voices""), Taj says ""her group was the one to beat."" Selling over six million records, her time as a singer has prepared her for the spotlight. 
<br/><br/>
In addition to her music career, Taj is also an accomplished writer. The author of âPlayer HateHER:  How To Avoid The Beat Down And Live In A Drama Free World,"" she tries to practice what she preaches as her true pride and lifeâs focus lies within her family. The wife of Heisman Trophy winner and former Tennessee Titan running back Eddie George, she warns all opponents, ""I'm not the average NFL wife and mother.""  
<br/><br/>
Growing up in Brooklyn, Taj overcame both physical and mental abuse in her life. With her background, it's no wonder she says she's ""naturally distrustful.""

<br/><br/>
""A lot of times I've found that people don't think I'm smart enough to play games.""
says Erinn. Although she's fine with people thinking she's dumb because, according to her, ""she'll be dumb like a fox."" Those people couldn't be more wrong as she is ready to show off her strong people skills as well as her ability to read the faces of her competition. Through skills learned at her job, she's been able to adjust her behavior depending on the situation which can serve as a great strategy in the game.
<br/><br/>

Despite the fact that she is strong-willed and determined, she is one who will wear her heart on her sleeve. Not intimidated by age, (""I'm 25 and if you're 45 that's great, but if we have differences, I'm going to let you know""), Reed will speak her mind, yet she does it with purpose and passion. She hopes that her tenacity will balance out her ""strong nature.""
<br/><br/>
This fashion student and model is no stranger to roughing it. After moving to Taiwan by herself at a very young age, Sierra is used to living in places with no running water and filled with grime and bugs. Sierra is a self-proclaimed adventure junkie who ""loves to experience new things all the time"" and she believes that those experiences make her a prime candidate for SURVIVOR.
<br/><br/>
Sierra claims she isn't a ""very stereotypical model,"" because she doesn't do it for the notoriety; she does it because modeling can help facilitate new experiences and allows for travel to amazing locations which is something she enjoys tremendously.
<br/><br/>
Her modeling background has helped to shape her strategy for the game. Forced to deal with a variety of personalities all competing for the same goal is nothing new to her, having lived with five catty models vying for one spot. This experience will be to her advantage when forming alliances and making her way through the twists of the game.

Growing up in a poor family, he was one of 10 children who had to learn, very early on, the skills to help him survive in the real world. Jerry has been passing on those survival skills learned from his childhood to soldiers in the Army National Guard for the last 20 years.
<br/><br/>
A 1st Sergeant and specialist in Nuclear Operations, Sims just recently returned from a tour of duty in Afghanistan. No stranger to being in a leadership position, Sims was in charge of 100 men and not only knew how to manage them, but also earned their respect. ""With this big smile and this convincing attitude, I get them to do exactly what I want them to do!"" 
<br/><br/>
He's always been a strong proponent of the team concept, a skill that came in handy growing up in such a large household, especially around dinner time ""where you had to be on time!"" Jerry is also a family man, who's been married for 25 years and has both an adult son and daughter. He has no qualms about saying he's doing this for the money. ""The million is in my grasp! I've got to have it. I'm a competitor. I like to win. I like to win, win, win!""
<br/><br/>
Raised on a chicken farm in South Carolina, Jerry also knows how to live off the land and involve everyone in the daily chores.

Candace Smith grew up as a tomboy and athlete, competing in soccer, basketball and track.  She lacks fear or inhibition and is always ready to take on new challenges. This sexy former Miss Ohio USA has both beauty and brains, making her a real threat to her competitors.
  <br/><br/>
Candace prides herself in having both book and street smarts.  Growing up in the inner city of Dayton, Ohio, Candace worked hard to receive a full academic scholarship to the University of Dayton.  She went on to graduate from Northwestern University School of Law and began working as a commercial real estate attorney.  After becoming Miss Ohio USA, she decided to move to L.A. to pursue other aspirations, including modeling, acting and opening her own consulting firm. 
  <br/><br/>
Although Candace no longer practices law, she still utilizes her legal skills in everyday life. As an attorney, she mastered the skills of mental combat and knows how to create a strong bargaining position, which will certainly come in handy on SURVIVOR.  Candace has also learned how to relate to many different types of people from traveling all over the world, including England, Spain and Cuba. Aside from traveling, she also enjoys running, cooking and writing. She is currently working on a book of her memoirs. 
<br/><br/>
 While friends describe her as resilient, funny and overall positive, she admits she is brutally honest by nature and can come across as a bitch, which may cause her problems with her tribe.  Although she knows how to negotiate and be diplomatic, she has a difficult time socializing with phony people.  To win this game, she knows she'll have to be able to bite her tongue because she knows what's at risk.  A victory would help provide the children in her family with funds for education and she hopes that a strong mix of athleticism and work ethic will take her to the end.

Aside from setting the world record for the longest solo kayak expedition on the ocean (an amazing 6,132 miles), Wade has also been attacked by a tiger shark, stalked by a jaguar in the Amazon and has been bitten by a piranha on his right hand.

He feels that his fatherâs example has provided him with tools that will help him win this game. In addition to his fatherâs influence, Erik is self-motivated by his competitive nature and desire to prove to himself that he has what it takes to be the next Sole Survivor. <br/><br/>Currently, Erik resides in Los Angeles, Calif.

Jaison,19,"<div class=""cast-bio"" id=""js-character-copy"">Jaison Robinson (28)<br/>Hometown: Chicago, Ill.<br/>Occupation: Law Student<br/><br/>Both physically and mentally prepared for the game of SURVIVOR, Jaison is a very educated 28-year-old, who is currently working on his law degree from the University of Chicago. Before deciding to obtain his undergraduate degree from Stanford University, this goal-oriented academic was given a congressional nomination to attend both the Air Force and the Naval Academy. Even though Jaison chose a route other than the military, he still contemplates one day working in the armed forces in order to serve his country.<br/> <br/>In addition to his current focus on education, this Eagle Scout is extremely active. Named âMr. Californiaâ by Cosmopolitan magazine, Jaison is also an avid sports lover and enjoys basketball, football and hiking â he has even scaled the top ofÂ  Venezuelaâs Angel Falls, the highest waterfall in the world. He also feels that one of his greatest achievements is making the U.S. National Water Polo team. In addition to his love for physical activities, Jaison plays both the piano and the cello. <br/><br/>He dreams of waking up to the view a top Mount Everest and boasts that, for a million dollars, he would snowboard all the way down. His favorite board game, âDiplomacy,â gives a bit of insight as to how he plans to play SURVIVOR.Â  Much like SURVIVOR, âDiplomacyâ is a strategy game that uses communication, negation and deception in order to win. Even though he plans to use positive elements such as strength and intellect to win, he will not hesitate to betray others if it wins him the title of Sole Survivor.<br/><br/>Jaison resides in Chicago, Ill. His birthday is September 25th.<br/></div>"
John,19,"<div class=""cast-bio"" id=""js-character-copy"">John Fincher (25)<br/>Hometown: Los Angeles, Calif.<br/>Occupation: Rocket Scientist<br/><br/>

John Fincher claims âwinningâ is his favorite hobby, and because of that he should have no problem playing the game of SURVIVOR. Being a rocket scientist probably will not hurt his chances either. This charmingly cocky genius believes he possesses the analytical skills necessary to take him far in the game while helping him create a mastermind strategy.  In addition to brains, he is a former semi-pro soccer player, who is also going to pose a physical threat in the game.
<br/><br/>
Fincher says that he is at his best during high pressure situations and times of complete chaos.  He finds idiots or âunskilledâ people amusing, and has no problem telling them to their face.  John has traveled extensively in South America, Europe, South Africa, and Canada, and he plans to use his experience of dealing with people from diverse backgrounds to his best advantage.
<br/><br/>
John is no stranger to creating conflict and thinks it could work to his advantage in the game. Although, John also believes his good looks and charm will help even out his aggressive personality, especially with the ladies. He also will not apologize living a privileged life and claims that he will party his way around the world with his winnings.  
<br/><br/>
John resides in Santa Monica, Calif. His birth date is August 16th.</div>"

She fully intends to use her beauty and the fact that she âcan sell ice cubes to an Eskimoâ to her advantage in the game.<br/> <br/>Exotic looks, in addition to intellect, have landed her a wide range of jobs, such as a clerk position at a well-known investment firm, as well as a position playing a theme park Pocahontas. With the keen ability to change from bookworm to party girl in a matter of moments, she is sure she will be able to adapt to anything she comes across on the island.

Standing tall at only 5â6â, he is built like a brick house with a bald head.

He is a dedicated father and a loving husband and describes a perfect day as spending time with his daughter and ending the day by âtalkingâ privately with his wife. <br/><br/>A passionate man, Russell cannot stand hearing over-generalizations about specific groupings of people and avoids discussing topics relating to race and sexuality because he feels that others usually have a hard time dealing with his conversation style. <br/><br/>Always prepared to joke and laugh at himself, Russell is willing to go to drastic lengths for a million dollars in order to win including making a vow to cut off his dreadlocks if he wins the title of sole SURVIVOR.<br/><br/>Currently, Russell resides in Glenside, Pa.

Yasmin Giles is nicknamed âSassy Yassyâ and is ready to show everybody how she got this moniker. An opinionated motor mouth from the Motor City, she always speaks her mind.
<br/> <br/>
Growing up in Detroit, Yasmin claims her life experiences have prepared her for anything that comes her way.  She is aware that her know-it-all attitude can rub people the wrong way, but she doesnât care. âIf youâre going to give it to somebody straight, real and raw, then a big mouth doesnât matter, because they are going to think about what I said and realize Yasmin was right!â
<br/> <br/>
Yasmin believes that once you get past her constant chatter, she is likeable, funny and quick-witted.

While she may look feminine, Yasmin insists sheâs a tomboy at heart.  
<br/> <br/>
A firm believer in the mantra âwinners never quit and quitters never win,â Yasmin claims sheâs a winner and sheâll never quit SURVIVOR. âI want to do this and I want to take it all the way.â

She has the ability to make everyone love her but also fear her. That power and confidence is a good quality to have for this show. I can also relate to Natalie Tenerelli because she was a young contestant and also a dancer.<br/><strong>Reason for Being on SURVIVOR:</strong> The chance to experience a once in a lifetime journey and to show everyone that just because I have huge boobs and a pretty face does not mean I am dumb, it just means I look better when I am winning.<br/><strong>Why You Think Youâll âSurviveâ SURVIVOR:</strong> I have great leadership skills when working in a group.

He has accumulated enormous wealth in starting several successful business ventures and constitutes the perfect embodiment of capitalism.<br/><strong>Hobbies:</strong> Chess, ultimate frisbee and partying.<br/><strong>Pet Peeves: </strong>People who are stupid but still voice their opinions, incompetent leaders, those who donât respect intelligence and those who expect handouts in life. 3 Words to Describe You: Brilliant, competitive and arrogant.<br/><strong>If You Could Have 3 Things on The Island What Would They Be and Why?</strong> A chess board â with a chess board present, I know I have the ability to impress whoever Iâm with. Regular practice is also important. The American Flag â perhaps my biggest source of pride is being an American; and The Economist â This is my preferred news source (despite the fact that itâs perceived as âsnobbishâ).<br/><strong>SURVIVOR Contestant You Are Most Like:</strong> The cleverness and strategic planning of Stephen, but the personality of Marty. Like Marty, I am a natural leader and can come off as pompous or bombastic. Also, I shared Martyâs disdain for Jane on S21.<br/><strong>Reason for Being on SURVIVOR:</strong> The competition. Iâm insanely competitive in chess, pursuing a career in investment banking, and everything I do. I want to play the game of Survivor for the challenge, the competition and the chance to prove myself in such an epic game, under such trying circumstances. Also, the money. The expected value of playing Survivor is, monetarily alone, worth more than most peoplesâ salaries. I love $1,000,000 almost as much as winning.<br/><strong>Why You Think Youâll âSurviveâ SURVIVOR:</strong> Iâm a strong leader despite my young age, and have worked well in a team in a number of different academic, athletic and chess-related capacities. Iâm also extremely competitive and would be a large asset to a tribe in puzzles and endurance-related challenges, as well as strategic competitions.<br/><strong>Why You Think You Will Be the Sole SURVIVOR: </strong>Iâm the chess expert who can plan my victory 10 moves in advance. I can use economic game theory to know the incentives of those around me. Iâm the only guy who has these skills and is still personable enough to win. Think of me as a John Cochran who doesnât suck.<br/><strong>Do You Consider Yourself a Brain, a Beauty or a Brawn? </strong>A Brain, in both life and Survivor super fandom. I've seen every episode. I know the game inside and out. I'll know what I'm doing in camp life; I could probably even build a shelter just using rocks. When my body is withered and I'm left with only my t-shirt and tighty whities, I won't be a little boy out there.

SO RUDE!!!<br/><strong>3 Words to Describe You: </strong>Versatile, clever and competitive.<br/><strong>If You Could Have 3 Things on The Island What Would They Be and Why? </strong>Cigarettes, coffee and liquor. I donât smoke or drink coffee or liquor, but I would love to bring those items with me just so that I can barter with my tribemates! You know at some point in the game they would even give up immunity just to have a little taste of these items.<br/><strong>SURVIVOR Contestant You Are Most Like</strong>: Russell Hantz, because I can be just as devious. Boston Rob, because I can be just as slick.<br/><strong>Reason for Being on SURVIVOR:</strong> My main reason: The MILLION DOLLARS of course. There's no way I would be going out there for half that prize! Secondly, Iâm a huge fan of the show and I would love to give the fans a great season to be remembered.<br/><strong>Why You Think Youâll âSurviveâ SURVIVOR:</strong> Adapt and overcome! Thatâs the kind of training I have as a cop and thatâs exactly what Iâm going to do on that island! Adapt and I will overcome!<br/><strong>Why You Think You Will Be the Sole SURVIVOR: </strong>I have been a street cop for 12 years. My experiences as a cop give me a huge advantage going into this game. Being outside my element is my forte. That's what I do for a living. Whatâs going to be normal for me will be very stressful for the average castaway.<br/><strong>Do You Consider Yourself a Brain, a Beauty or a Brawn?</strong> Sounds like a trick question.

She played a true and honest game. She crushed the challenges and her social skills were top notch.<br/><strong>Reason for Being on SURVIVOR:</strong> From the birth of Survivor, everyone has told me I would be the best survivor âSurvivorâ ever had. I have diligently put tapes in when I thought the tape was the right time, and I believe years of manifesting and believing in myself and my girls at ages they are at, that this was the time to prove to not only myself but all the thousands of people I know DREAMS COME TRUE! Trick is you have to make them happen and never lose sight of your dreams. Dream Big!!<br/><strong>Why You Think Youâll âSurviveâ SURVIVOR:</strong> I am a great team player, a very hard worker, a very positive thinker and an incredible people person. I get along instantly with most people. I am not a control freak and I go with the flow.<br/><strong>Why You Think You Will Be the Sole SURVIVOR: </strong>My greatest strength is my intuition and my people skills. I am a chameleon with people and have an ability to read people and situations with great strength. On top of that, I have a lot of charisma and positive energy, and I am likeable, incredibly agile and a good athlete.<br/><strong>Do You Consider Yourself a Brain, a Beauty or a Brawn? </strong>I would consider myself a Brawn. I was raised in a home with four very tough brothers who were all incredible hockey players. They used to put me in goal and take slap shots off me from about two feet away when I was in kindergarten. Needless to say, they taught me well. I grew up athletic, tough and confident in the defense of myself and others. My life has been very difficult with many ugly and unpredictable obstacles and I made a conscious choice to never give up on myself or my dreams. I believe it is my God given tenacity and spirit that I was born with that gives me the title: Brawn. As my brother Mark always said so well, I am a TOUGHY TIGER!!<br/><strong>Who Do You Think Has the Best Chance in the Game of Survivor: Brains, Beauty or Brawn? </strong>I think that the Brawns will win without question as long as they do not allow their egos to take over. I think common sense in the game of Survivor is essential and often times really smart people lack that. I also think it is one thing to be able to build a spaceship and whole different story when it comes to building a shelter and toughing it out in the woods. Beauty is just beauty. How do you build shelter, fires and boil your own water on your looks? I think a Brawn will win.<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/video/3LK5qcM9ET30NaVjkX9wCrX4H3pfErde/survivor-cagayan-meet-trish/"">Watch Trish's Cast Video!</a></p></div>"

Reason for Being on SURVIVOR: Adventure of a life time. Itâs a great opportunity to test myself both physically and mentally. Also, itâs a great chance to participate in an amazing game for the chance to be crowned the Sole Survivor and win a million stacks!<br/><strong>Why You Think Youâll âSurviveâ SURVIVOR:</strong> I have both the physical and social game to make it to the end.

If I had to choose one, I would say Brawn because as sports athletes they understand pressure situations of competition (composure). They have the where with all of team play, and with the structure of the game of survivor in order to advance in the game you need the help of your teammates (supportive). Brain's would fail because of their know-it-all attitudes (conflicting). The Beauties would fail because they will sit back and expect everything to be handed to them.<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/video/56twvH3MBZMRkrBUfxV7CCKNU8UuSCVQ/survivor-cagayan-meet-woo/"">Watch Woo's Cast Video!</a></p></div>"

In college, I played indoor volleyball at Northern Arizona University. After four years of being self-coached and self-funded, we upset the number one team in the nation in the finals of a Vegas tournament.<br/><strong>Inspiration in Life:</strong> My Dad. My whole life, he was incredibly hard on me and always pushing me to become better at everything I did. He grew up very poor and in a large family in which he endured a lot of hardships.

My primary motivation is that every day I dream about competing and earning the title of sole Survivor. With every season, my desire to play has grown more and more.

This has taught me how to communicate and connect with people I donât know. Iâm a very social person and I enjoy getting to know people and their story. Being one of the most important aspects of Survivor, I feel my social game will be strong and lead to my success in the game<br/><strong>Why Will You Be the Sole SURVIVOR:</strong> With every season I watch, I canât help but imagine that I'm actually in the game playing.

Of course, itâs different when youâre sitting at home on the couch and know what every player is thinking. However, I feel that I am well rounded enough, athletic enough and mentally strong enough to adapt to the people Iâm put with. I am confident in the life skills I possess and I feel I can maintain my focus despite all of the other personal and crazy things the game may and will throw my way. After being such a huge fan for so many years, I truly respect how complex and challenging the game is. I am ready to battle and I want my shot in the ultimate arena that is Survivor.</p></div>"

He is a man of morals and values and he is a man of his word. He means what he says and is who he says. What a mentor.<br/><strong>Hobbies:</strong> Disc golf, running and picking up the ladies! Haha!<br/><strong>What is your favorite sport?</strong> When I was younger, it was playing football because the sound of someone losing their air is awesome. Now that I am older, it is disc golf because I love the challenge of me against the course.<br/><strong>Pet Peeves:</strong> People who are bad at time management. If you say youâre going to be somewhere at a certain time, be there! Also spelling, I canât stand it when someone canât spell.<br/><strong>3 Words to Describe You:</strong> Loyal, Ambitious and Clever.<br/><strong>If You Could Have 3 Things on The Island What Would They Be and Why?</strong> 1. Any ball because I can make a game out of anything, MacGyver-ish in this case. But it would be nice to have a ball. 2. Toilet paper because it kind of stinks rubbing your bum with your hands. 3. Tooth brush because itâs refreshing not having yuck mouth.<br/><strong>SURVIVOR Contestant You Are Most Like:</strong> Cochran, because he knows the game and how to move pieces; Ozzy because that dude has the best posture of anyone and heâs a bad ass; and Rob because he takes over and gives 110% at everything.<br/><strong>Reason for Being on SURVIVOR: </strong>Thereâs a competitive fire inside me. I canât get enough. I live to compete daily in my own life. If you guys let me loose on the challenges you will see. Also, I want to see if I am as good of a manipulator as I think I am.<br/>Why Youâll âSurviveâ SURVIVOR: I have a never-quit attitude. If I have to die, I will before I quit! I am also confident in who I am and what I can do and canât do. The ole âfake it till you make itâ applies here. I also am a leader; people naturally flock to me because of my outgoing attitude on life.<br/><strong>Why Will You Be the Sole SURVIVOR: </strong>My life is constantly changing. At work, I must adapt to what the oil well is doing and sometimes drastic measures need to be taken. In my personal life, I have had to overcome being molested and bullied when I was young and not having a father. Learning to be influenced by the right people has been no easy chore. I have grown into my own skin - I know who I am and what I am about. My faith has made me whole, my family and friends have me strong, and my experiences have made me adapt. Letâs get it on!!!!</p></div>"

She moved to the U.S. after marrying my dad and giving birth to me. It wasnât a dream of hers to move to the U.S., but she fell in love and made the ultimate sacrifice. Upon moving here, she took English lessons and got her citizenship. Moving here did not come easy, people were prejudiced and mean-spirited, but she didnât let that get her down.

Iâm hard working and have great organizational and leadership skills and Iâd bring energy and motivation since Iâm always the optimist.<br/><strong>Why Will You Be the Sole SURVIVOR:</strong> I have always said that to win Survivor you need to sell yourself. That is something in my favor because of my own persuasive abilities. I also feel strategy is important and I have always been a proactive person. I donât like surprises and therefore I am always thinking one step ahead.</p></div>"

Reason for Being on SURVIVOR: I love SURVIVOR. Since I was 15, Iâve watched. As complicated as the game is, thereâs something so simple, authentic and raw. I have deep respect for the timelessness and evolution of the game.
</p>
<p>
Why You Think Youâll âSurviveâ SURVIVOR: Iâm a hard worker who never gives up, and Iâd entertain people by pulling a Greg Buis and being a weirdo. People would think I was doing this to be funny and pass time, but Iâd actually be extracting key details. After living in Salem, MA during several Halloweens, Iâve learned to embrace my quirkiness and work with outlandish personalities.
</p>
<p>
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole SURVIVOR: Iâm an expert listener and a journalist at heart so Iâm inherently observant and social. I look for the most genuine and self-aware person in the room so I can connect with them, and I'm on the prowl for the most fake person in the room so I know what Iâm dealing with. I want to prove to myself that I have what it takes to manage personalities under pressure with $1,000,000 on the line.

</p>
<p>
If You Could Have 3 Things on the Island What Would They Be and Why? My journal to remind myself of my past and to keep track of my future, a Harry Potter book for a little entertainment, and my sister (does she count?).
</p>
<p>
SURVIVOR Contestant You Are Most Like: Parvati. She was able to read people and form alliances that took the spotlight off of her. She took respectable chances, never silenced herself to get further, and dominated in challenges.
</p>
<p>
Reason for Being on SURVIVOR: The adventure junky in me wants take myself out of my comfort zone, but ultimately, I'm applying to win. It's all about the money, honey! My car shakes at any speed over 50mph so I desperately need to replace that tin can.
</p>
<p>
Why You Think Youâll âSurviveâ SURVIVOR: My positivity. I wouldnât let anything dampen my spirit. Enthusiasm is electric, and that attitude would shape the tone around camp. I may be a Jersey girl, but don't let that fool you. I have no problem roughin' it.
</p>
<p>

<p>
Occupation: Body Builder
</p>
<p>
Personal Claim to Fame: I am most proud of receiving my International Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness Pro card at the National Physique Committee Nationals in 2012. I was a junior at Penn at the time and Iâd just turned 20. I had to train 3 times a day, not including track practice, in order to make my dream happen.
</p>
<p>
Inspiration in Life: My mother. She is the strongest woman I know and her loyalty is forever unwavering. She has been diagnosed with breast cancer twice, and even though she could barely walk from her chemo treatment, she still put me first and flew into support my bodybuilding show.
</p>
<p>
Hobbies: Sprinting, lifting/weight training and sleeping.
</p>
<p>
Pet Peeves: Obnoxious criers, bigots, overly weak people and basically anything related to closed-minded mentalities.
</p>
<p>
3 Words to Describe You: Opinionated, driven and disciplined.
</p>
<p>
If You Could Have 3 Things on the Island What Would They Be and Why? Branch chain amino acids/supplements- I need my vitamins so I hopefully wonât lose all my muscle; a picture of my family and friends for motivation; and tweezers because my eyebrows can get crazy.
</p>
<p>
SURVIVOR Contestant You Are Most Like: Tony, because his loyalty to those who really mattered was unwavering. He played the game from the beginning to the end.
</p>
<p>
Reason for Being on SURVIVOR: My main reason for being on the show is winning the money to pay off medical school and college debt. I also want to be able to help my mother around the house so she doesnât have to decide which bills need to be paid.
</p>
<p>
Why You Think Youâll âSurviveâ SURVIVOR: My sense of humor will be most useful. You canât walk around looking like someone killed your dog all day. I think I will up the team morale. Beyond that, I think my athletic abilities can help win this competition.
</p>
<p>
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole SURVIVOR: I believe that I have the tact and discipline to make it to the end. If I make it to the final 3, Iâm confident I would get the needed votes because I will have created relationships and a story that my fellow tribe mates would want to vote for.

<p>
Occupation: Ice Cream Entrepreneur
</p>
<p>
Personal Claim to Fame: I started Three Twins Ice Cream with my lifeâs savings of $70,000 in 2005 at age 28 after returning from the Peace Corps. I couldn't afford employees, so I did everything myself at first. I opened another shop, then another and then built a factory in 2010 to start selling pints to grocery stores, and have since opened a second factory. We're now sold in grocery stores in all 50 states, have a team of around 100 and sales this year that will be about 100 times sales from the first year, despite almost going broke during the economic downturn and unrelenting competition. I am proud of the growth, taking on the challenges, being creative, treating employees well, giving a great deal back and inspiring others through my version of the American dream.
</p>
<p>
Inspiration in Life: I am not much for heroes, but the person who has come closest to obtaining hero status is my Uncle Larry. I admire him for the deep and devoted love that he had for my aunt. Despite being a tough guy, he has never been afraid to cry or share his feelings. I admire him for his larger-than-life deeds, like finding 55 pounds of cocaine off the coast of Florida (heâs a former cop and turned it in). I admired him because of his Popeye-like muscle on his forearm, which I later found out is actually a tumor, but I didnât know that as a kid. But more than anything, I have always admired him for being himself.
</p>
<p>
Hobbies: Traveling, indoor rock climbing and one-upmanship.
</p>
<p>
Pet Peeves: I am not really one to complain and therefore donât have too many pet peeves but I do have very little patience for whiny people and hypocritical bible thumpers.
</p>
<p>
3 Words to Describe You: Incorrigible, witty and kind.
</p>
<p>
If You Could Have 3 Things on the Island What Would They Be and Why? I would take a big comfortable bed with high thread count sheets, a down comforter and lush pillows to facilitate good nightsâ sleep and an assortment of fake immunity idols and fake printed clues on convincing paper to fool my fellow contestants into thinking that they have immunity. Lastly, a spy kit so that I can bug camp and listen in on the plotting and scheming of my campmates to give me valuable information.
</p>
<p>
SURVIVOR Contestant You Are Most Like: I relate to Erik Reichenbach as my brother in ice cream. I can relate to Rob Mariano because he not only won but he seemed to have more fun than anyone else while doing so. I can relate to Tyson for his priceless, witty commentary on the other players. I relate to Parvarti because I think that Iâll also charm my fellow competitors while Iâm busy destroying them. I kind of hate myself for saying this, but I relate to Russell Hantz for his lack of fear and filter.
</p>
<p>
Reason for Being on SURVIVOR: My primary reason is to win, as is my secondary reason. Winning the money will be amazing but I am more interested in the metaphorical crown, bragging rights and satisfaction that comes with winning than the cash. It is also to have the privilege to compete in what I consider one of the greatest competitions of all. I have watched the show for years and yearn for the chance to be a castaway in a remote locale and compete for 39 days.
</p>
<p>
Why You Think Youâll âSurviveâ SURVIVOR: I will be the provider for the group and the court jester. I will be a calming force and the one that psyches up the tribe to go into battle. I am a strong swimmer and will be a valuable hunter, fisher and gatherer for the group. I have a tireless work ethic and will contribute more than my fair share towards building a strong shelter, cooking and getting water. I am most often happy, quite witty, never complain and am generally entertaining, which will help to keep the peace during tough and stressful times. I am physically and mentally strong, I was a competitive athlete for years, I am a fast runner and sharp, so I will be strong in challenges.
</p>
<p>
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole SURVIVOR: I have been a SURVIVOR fan for years and therefore understand the game, am mentally tough, a physical force, likable and absolutely determined to win. I will excel at both the social and physical game. Much of my life has prepared me to be a great contestant. Being a fan has shown me some brilliant moves and perhaps more importantly, stupid ones to avoid. More than anything, I believe that I will be the sole Survivor because I want to and I usually get what I want, no matter how hard I have to work for it.

<p>
Personal Claim to Fame: Graduating from college. It has been a long and hard road, but I did it! I was horrible in high school because I didnât give a damn, not because I wasnât smart. Now I have finished college and not only that, I did it with a 3.47GPA while working jobs all day and night.
</p>
<p>
Inspiration in Life: Growing up, I never had a hero, just examples of what not to do. If I had to pick a hero, it would be Jesus, someone who was willing to sacrifice himself for the good of others even when they didnât deserve it. Thatâs real.

If You Could Have 3 Things on the Island What Would They Be and Why? Sunglasses so I can hide from the ugly contestants; iPod, so I can tune the haters out; pack of cigarettes.
</p>
<p>
SURVIVOR Contestant You Are Most Like: Survivor is all about evaluating your circumstances. I can say I want to play the game like B Rob, Sean Rector, or Tony and be in control the whole time. One thing I would want to do is be likeable, be the JT then cut their throats one by one while they donât see me. I just have to keep others fighting and I will be fine.
</p>
<p>
Reason for Being on SURVIVOR: I want to prove to the world that I can win and be successful in life despite my past. I want to encourage other people who think theyâre useless and do something worth value. I also want to become the best survivor ever! I want to be forever remembered as the ultimate Survivor!
</p>
<p>
Why You Think Youâll âSurviveâ SURVIVOR: I have been all around the country, love the outdoors and love to fish. I know CPR first aid because I was a lifeguard. My social game will always be up to par and I am an extremely hard worker.
</p>
<p>
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole SURVIVOR: I have been through adversities. I know how it feels to fail. But I also know how to win. Using negative energy to dig deep and win, thatâs the mind you have to have coming into this game. I am a hard worker and a great team player. I have done a little of everything and I can say I have a well-rounded skill set. I have a lot to prove, in my eyes, and I wonât let anyone stop me from winning!

<p>
If You Could Have 3 Things on the Island What Would They Be and Why? Hair ties, energy drinks and a mini DVD player.
</p>
<p>
SURVIVOR Contestant You Are Most Like: Russell Hantz because he is the only person that has ever truly played the game the way you should. The only difference is that I wouldnât wait so long making things disappear.
</p>
<p>
Reason for Being on SURVIVOR: Truthfully, for the money. I have a family that is very important to me and that is why I work so hard. My youngest daughter has autism and is always in some form of therapy. It costs a lot of money and I make it work, but it would be nice to have some real money in my bank so I donât worry about her as much. I have been watching this game from Season 1, when Rudy shouldâve won until he took his hand off that log. I can play this game and want that Survivor title.
</p>
<p>
Why You Think Youâll âSurviveâ SURVIVOR: I have spent years living in third world countries and war zones- I know how to survive. I can make fire, build shelter, last as long as needed, go days without food and I work extremely hard.
</p>
<p>
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole SURVIVOR: I really do believe I can win this competition. I lie for a living, day in and day out. I have no shame telling people what they want to hear so I can stab them in the back and make it look like someone else. I know this game too well, watching it from the start, and I believe I can play it in the way it should be played and be the first to win in that way.

</p>
<p>
SURVIVOR Contestant You Are Most Like: Parvati. I can be charming and would play up my innocent side so I could trick some males and wrap them around my finger.
</p>
<p>
Reason for Being on SURVIVOR: I am a huge fan of Survivor and I have studied it for a long time. Iâm clever enough to play this game well and win. My biggest inspiration to win is my mother. She is currently unemployed and I am supporting her so winning that money would help me buy a house for her.
</p>
<p>
Why You Think Youâll âSurviveâ SURVIVOR: I will be great outdoors. I'm not a girly girl so the dirty, smelly, sleep- depriving environment wonât be so hard for me. I'm not lazy and would help the tribe tremendously in anything that would need to be done. I can catch fish, and I eat small portions. I am physically capable of kickin' butt out there. I have tons of energy which will help me last throughout the game.
</p>
<p>
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole SURVIVOR: I know I will be the sole Survivor because I am extremely good with people and I would form great relationships that could help me from getting voted out. I would make it to the end because I am not afraid to make moves. I will do what it takes to win.

</p>

Hobbies: Riding motorcycles, eating good food, playing board games and adventure racing.

<p>
SURVIVOR Contestant You Are Most Like: Kim Spradlin. She had strategy: making as many friends as possible, having alliances and sub-alliances. She was just âherself,â which is exactly how I play everyday life. I earn respect, like Kim, by telling you how it is. Iâm practical but also love the excitement of making big moves.
</p>
<p>
Reason for Being on SURVIVOR: This once in a lifetime chance is filled with challenges and adventure. I want to live 100 years, not 1 year 100 times over. I want tree mail instead of email. I like playing games, getting my hands dirty, causing trouble and getting away with it! Also, for the money. Iâm ready to adopt children and start a family.

Why You Think You Will Be the Sole SURVIVOR: Winning Survivor takes practice- practice surviving. Iâve been through hell and back many times.

Winning doesnât take beauty, brains or brawn- it takes heart!

<p>
If You Could Have 3 Things on the Island What Would They Be and Why? Alcohol. Thereâs nothing like a truth serum to give the other contestants. A picture of other contestantâs loved ones to negotiate with. A vacuum, so people think Iâm dumber than they initially thought.
</p>

Reason for Being on SURVIVOR: Winning a million dollars and showing the other contestants that signing up for my season of Survivor was a bad idea.
</p>
<p>
Why You Think Youâll âSurviveâ SURVIVOR: Iâm athletic, but the most useful skill is my positive nature.

<p>
Reason for Being on SURVIVOR: Winning the money to better life financing. Also, I love the woods and anything survival related. I feel I can survive anything, so I want to be put to the test!

Why You Think You Will Be the Sole SURVIVOR: I have the skills it takes to get through the tough situations of little to no water, or little to no food and I make things happen. If I made it through a war zone for 11 months, I can make it through a jungle for 39 days!

<p>
If You Could Have 3 Things on the Island What Would They Be and Why? A photo of my family because theyâre my rock! A camera because I love taking pictures to document memories and for Instagram! An iPod because a girlâs gotta jam out!
</p>
<p>
SURVIVOR Contestant You Are Most Like: Natalie Tenerelli because she was a young, female player, Jenna Morasca and Parvati Shallow because of their ability to strategically combine sex appeal and intelligence, and Andrea Boehlke because she is a wholesome farm girl with big dreams.
</p>
<p>
Reason for Being on SURVIVOR: I want to win the million dollars and also pay off my college tuition! I want to prove to everyone who ever doubted me that I am strong, strategic and intelligent, not just some Barbie princess, dumb blonde.
</p>
<p>
Why You Think Youâll âSurviveâ SURVIVOR: I would be a huge asset on camp. I have done Habitat for Humanity so I know how to build shelter. I have killed cows in Africa, worked on a farm, and know how to make fire. Iâm also quick, excellent at puzzles, and have strong social skills from job experience and being a college student.

<p>
Personal Claim to Fame: Being a part of the AIDS Life Cycle ride for the past 13 years. A 545-miles, 7-day camping and bicycle ride from SF to LA to benefit HIV and AIDS services. In total, Iâve raised over $75,000 for the LA LGBT Center and SF AIDS Foundation. I love this grueling, but fun, mental and physical challenging experience.
</p>
<p>
Inspiration in Life: My parents. They worked so hard to provide for 11 of my siblings. During and after the Vietnam war, we were so poor, we had to eat plain rice with soy sauce for months. Somehow they managed to get us all on a fishing boat to escape Communism and luckily we all survived 11 days on the open ocean. In an Indonesian refugee camp, my mom made and sold one cookie at a time to earn extra money for her children. They are the ones that taught me self-reliance and my mom always reminds me âIf you have health and both hands, you can never go to sleep cold or hungry.â

<p>
3 Words to Describe You: Energetic, resourceful and competitive.
</p>
<p>
If You Could Have 3 Things on the Island What Would They Be and Why? Coffee-my life necessity, I grew up loving Vietnamese coffee since I was 3 years old; a razor- I like to shave my head and face to feel young (a survival must) and clean; âThe Windup Bird Chronicle,â itâs a surreal Japanese fiction that would relax me.
</p>
<p>
SURVIVOR Contestant You Are Most Like: Spencer, I like his positive spirit and determination to survive in given situations, and Bob Crowley, because weâre both older, nice, likable players with non-threatening demeanors who work hard.
</p>
<p>
Reason for Being on SURVIVOR: Definitely, the fun of testing my ability to survive in harsh conditions, pushing my body physically and mentally to the fullest. I would love to compete in challenges against younger, stronger or bigger players to prove that size and age does not matter in this game. I believe in playing a good social game, and the nice guy always can win in the end. Also, to win the million dollars!
</p>
<p>
Why You Think Youâll âSurviveâ SURVIVOR: As a gardener and fishermen, I have the outdoor skills to build shelter, climb trees, forage for food, fish and dive. I am a vegetarian but I will harvest sea life for the tribe if it keeps me in the game. I will be useful and work hard at camp. Iâm physically fit and will help win challenges. Being the middle child of 11 kids, I know how to get along and be the peacemaker. I can share my childhood war stories to pass time and charm people while bringing good spirit and harmony to the tribe.
</p>
<p>
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole SURVIVOR: Growing up poor and without many of lifeâs comforts, I have the physical and mental stamina to survive in harsh environments. Iâm determined and never give up till I get what Iâm after. I am short and non-threatening, most people seem to like me and often are drawn to me for whatever reason. I am genuinely nice and will treat everyone well (but donât cross me, not even once). I will do whatever it takes to become the Sole Survivor. Even though itâll be difficult and devastating to betray my alliance, my ultimate goal is to win. I want to be a winner that everyone thinks is a little odd, but endearing, who plays a smart and interesting game with some spicy drama.

</p>
<p>
Why You Think You Will Be the Sole SURVIVOR: Like Hannibal Lecter, I have good manners and am pleasant company. However, that doesnât mean I wonât scramble your brains. One million dollars means freedom, which is priceless to me. Iâll give up, let go, surrender- when Iâm dead!

<p>
<strong>Pet peeves:</strong> Bullies, long lines, and smokers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What does it mean to be a Millennial?</strong><br/>
Millennials believe that, in this moment, anything is possible. If you have dreams, go after them. If you want to change the world, change it. I don't believe you have to ""pay your dues"" making copies and fetching coffee before you can be successfulâor before you can make a difference.
</p>
<p>
Donât just work harder, work smarter, and make your goals a reality! My dream is to win <em>Survivor</em> and I'm going to make it happen!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personal claim to fame:</strong><br/>
As a volunteer, I chaired a Relay For Life event that raised over $135,000 for cancer research and grew in size from about 10 youth participants to over 500. If any of that money helps save my mom's life, then it is, by far, my most important accomplishment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Inspiration in life:</strong><br/>
My mom. She is surviving lung cancer and has survivorship in her blood [because] her mom survived Auschwitz. She is incredibly physically fit and otherwise healthy. She can tear up the dance floorâthat's where I get my moves!âand she's my best friend and supporter.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
A picture of my family to keep myself grounded and focused, a fake hidden Immunity Idol because the threat can be just as powerful as the real thing, and a razor because I hate mustaches with a fiery passion.

We are both wise beyond our years, can easily play up to the egos of older and stronger players, are strategic thinkers, and are widely underestimated in the game.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>:</strong><br/>
When I set a goal in life, I achieve it. As an ultimate super-duper fan, winning <em>Survivor</em> is an unrealized goal that I simply must accomplish. I have dreamed of winning <em>Survivor</em> since I was 9 years old, even going so far as to play <em>Survivor</em> online when I was in middle school.
</p>
<p>
The money is secondary, but not unimportant because it would allow me to continue my passion for social justice.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why do you think youâll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
No one is going to fight as hard as I will for that title. I may beâand lookâyoung, I may be small, but my fellow competitors won't know what kind of power punch I pack until they are already knocked out. I will use my youthful charm and energy, combined with my strategic nature to win. I come from a long line of real-life survivors, and I am next.

<strong>What does it mean to be a Gen-Xer?</strong><br/>
A Gen-Xer is someone who had to work very hard for everything that they have in life. They actually had to go to school (not just online), ride the bus, and study hard to get good grades. Gen-Xer's take responsibility for their own actions and donât blame others for their mistakes.

<strong>Pet peeves:</strong> Smacking gum. I hate it. I would do away with all gum on earth if I could.

<p>
<strong>What does it mean to be a Gen-Xer? </strong><br/>
To me, it means that you work hard. It means you get up with a purpose and a goal each day. It means that you can do anything in America as long as you work hard and never give up.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personal claim to fame: </strong><br/>
I came from nothing. I came from a trailer with no running water left behind by a drug-trafficking father at 15. I overcame tremendous odds. I put myself through college on a football scholarship. I put myself through law school. I did this on my own and have earned the respect of an entire community.
</p>
<p>
For years, my hometown of Sulphur, Oklahoma, had a sign that said: ""The Home of Chris Hammons."" The sign is actually in my garage now.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Inspiration in life:</strong><br/>
Gerry Spence because heâs the America's greatest trial lawyer that ever lived. He has fought for American rights longer than Iâve been alive. He gives me inspiration to continue that great fight so the accused, the oppressed, the injured, the âlittle guyâ will have a voice in America.
</p>
<p>
When we, trial lawyers, quit fighting, Americans will have no voice. He is a true patriot and the most loving man I have ever met. Without his program and path, I might have been lost the rest of my life.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? </strong><br/>
A medicine pouch given to me by an Indian Chief and blessed with love and caring, which would give me power in challenges; a journal and pencil to document my adventure but, more than that, write down all the details of each member so I could memorize their stories better; and a picture of my boys. I would use the pain of not seeing them as motivation. When I feel down, I will look at that picture and turn the sadness to <em>rage</em> for a challenge.

<strong>What does it mean to be a Gen-Xer? </strong><br/>
Wow, just thinking about my history, childhood, and past brings me to tears, but also makes me smile. I came from a generation of fighters. The foundation of my family was built on strong women. Yes, my great grandparents, grandparents, and parents were married but, unfortunately, they didn't stay married. During that time, raising children as a single parent was be extremely hard, but the strength the women of my family showedâtheir will to never give up, their triumph over sweat and tearsâshaped me into the woman I am today.
</p>
<p>
We are strong and most of the women I grew up with also demonstrate that same strength and willpower. Nothing was handed to us. We worked hard and, if we failed, we tried again. That's the overall mindset of a Gen-Xer. Never let your failures keep you down. You only stay a failure if you don't get back up and try again.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personal claim to fame: </strong><br/>
Overcoming adversity and striving to be the best mother I can be to my children by supporting and pushing them to achieve their goals and dreams while, at the same time, still pushing to achieve my own goals and dreams.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Inspiration in life:</strong><br/>
My grandmother, Eleanor, because she's a lover, a giver, and she always gives her very last to help anyone, especially her family. Her home is always open and sheâs always spreading love through her cooking. If youâre hungry, you can always sit down and enjoy a meal at my grandmotherâs house. Sheâs one of my biggest supporters.

<p>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
The Bible, which was a gift from my grandfather and I read it daily, and a photograph of my children because they're the strength that keep me going.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>:</strong><br/>
A better life for my family. I'm tired of struggling and living check-to-check, or waiting for pay day to buy groceries. I'm tired of living off of my credit card and I love the game. Being on this show is the biggest accomplishment of my life.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>? </strong><br/>
I overcame so much adversity in my life. I moved across the country with my children just to provide a better life and opportunity for them. My mind is set to never give up and to keep striving for what I want, so this will be the ultimate goal in my life.

<strong>Personal claim to fame:</strong><br/>
Playing chess against Magnus Carlsen, the No. 1 ranked player in the world.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Inspiration in life:</strong><br/>
Mr. Spock [from <em>Star Trek</em>]. He's highly intelligent, logical, and has trouble fitting in. If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? Beads, string, and polished stones to make fake Immunity Idols for other people to find.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>:</strong><br/>
I want to use <em>Survivor</em> as a tool to battle my insecurities and overcome my fears and anxiety.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>? </strong><br/>
My weaknesses and flaws are my strengths. Because of my small size and lack of physical stature, people won't perceive me as a threat.
</p>
<p>
I also have the most important <em>Survivor</em> trait one can have: paranoia. My eyes and ears will be at full attention, searching for any hint of a vote going bad for me. Chess has taught me to always look ahead, so I'm prepared to seize an opportunity when one presents itself. I won't let emotions and feelings stand in the way of reaching Final 3.

<strong>Age:</strong> 24<br/>

<strong>Occupation:</strong> Barista<br/>
<strong>Tribe designation:</strong> Vanua (Millennials)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Nerdy, competitive, and weird.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hobbies:</strong> Skiing, scuba diving, eating, plus I can hula-hoop and walk at the same time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Pet peeves:</strong> Someone who likes to kill people. Not sure why, that's just such a pet peeve of mine! Also, people who stick their gum on public benches or fart in small elevators.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What does it mean to be a Millennial?</strong><br/>
Being a Millennial means being hip, cool, nifty and totally rad. Go young people! No, I'm not secretly an 80-year-old neurotic Jewish lady. I don't know what you're talking about.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personal claim to fame: </strong><br/>
I was Ben Franklin in my eighth-grade production of 1776. I sang out of tune, people clapped, and it was an electric moment of fame.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Inspiration in life: </strong><br/>
My mother. She has super-human levels of toughness. I cry when I bump my arm into something too hard, when an authority figure yells at me, or if I see a video of a cat being tickled. My mom is the opposite. She is a freakin' warrior and I'm her odd, terrified child.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? </strong><br/>
1. A journal: One with an old school lock on it that says ""KEEP OUT"" on the front. That way, I could write to stay sane and nobody would read what I wrote because there's a ""KEEP OUT"" sign on it.<br/>
2. An old buff I bought: I did a two-week rafting trip a while back to see if I could handle <em>Survivor</em> because I had never camped before.<br/>
3. An old-timey compass: People would be, like, she must be hip! Just look at that old-timey compass.

He used his humor and fish out of water-ness to control the game without seeming threatening. Cochran had a buff collection and wrote a paper on <em>Survivor</em> at Harvard Law School. I wrote my college common application essay about wanting to be on <em>Survivor</em>, so I can relate to his super fan-ness; plus, we were both <em>obviously</em> super cool in middle school.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>:</strong><br/>
I've been a fan of <em>Survivor</em> since I was 14. My friend and I would throw <em>Survivor</em> parties where we would eat worms and dirt (aka gummy worms and Oreos), while the castaways starved, and fancy food when they won Reward challenges. Simply stated, being a <em>Survivor</em> contestant has been a dream of mine forever. Plus, I like the idea that 14-year-old me would find 24-year-old me cool.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I probably won't. I've tripped walking down a sidewalk, so imagine that person in the wilderness.

<strong>Age:</strong> 23<br/>
<strong>Current residence:</strong> Nashville, TN<br/>
<strong>Occupation:</strong> Bartender<br/>
<strong>Tribe designation:</strong> Vanua (Millennials)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Adventurous, free spirit, and crowd pleaser.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hobbies:</strong> Kayaking, videography, and watching football.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Pet peeves: </strong>When people are lazy and expect things to just happen. That's not what life is about. Get up and fight.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What does it mean to be a Millennial? </strong><br/>
Being a Millennial means being blessed with an innovative and creative mind, and the world is at my fingertips. It's all there; I just have to make it happen.
</p>
<p>
I work hard for where I want to be and for everything I have. Millennials get stuff done and work hard while throwing a good snap in our [Snapchat] stories every now and again.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personal claim to fame:</strong><br/>
Moving to Nashville and standing on my own two feet at a vulnerable moment in my life. Leaving all that you know for a city of unfamiliarity? Scary. That's why I'm ready for a bigger challenge. Survivor is the ultimate challenge.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Inspiration in life:</strong><br/>
My mother. She did everything she could to make life for us okay, having gone through a very toxic relationship with our father. She showed me courage and strength in standing up for herself and showing us what we are worth. I admire her for that.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? </strong><br/>
I'd bring a razor, a pair of water shoesâI'd rather not step on sea urchins, but if I must, I mustâand a blanket. I don't consider that to be a survival item; I could use a tribe member for that.

She's just so tough in so many ways and she's strategic. She shows some moments of weakness but, at the end of it, she is still a tough chick and she fights to stay alive. I admire her.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>:</strong><br/>
The challenge. I was brought up in a crazy household outside of the inner city with crime happening right outside our windows. I have had to fight for everything I have ever had in my life, and Survivor is the ultimate fight I want to take on. Mentally and physically, my strength is unreal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>? </strong><br/>
Of course I'll survive. Why else would I even apply? I'm young and full of knowledge. I don't just go along for the ride; I'm a leader. I will lead my tribe and make it to the end with my lovable personality, my drive, and work ethic. It's destiny.

<strong>Name:</strong> Jessica Lewis<br/>
<strong>Age:</strong> 37<br/>
<strong>Current residence:</strong> Voorheesville, NY<br/>
<strong>Occupation:</strong> Assistant district attorney<br/>
<strong>Tribe designation:</strong> Takali (Gen-X)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Unique, unconventional, and intriguing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hobbies:</strong> Painting, baking, and photography.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Pet peeves:</strong> People who blame others for their own misery.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What does it mean to be a Gen-Xer? </strong><br/>
My parents were farmers and they worked harder than anyone I have ever known. There were no vacations, days off, or breaks. No matter the weather, their health, or lack of money, they never gave up. They never stopped.
</p>
<p>
That lesson has never left me. No one will live my life for me. No one is going to give me a break. If I want something, I have to get up and do it, regardless of how I may feel or how hard it may be. My life was decided by no one but myself. I saw the struggle my parents endured and I made a promise to myself to never stop trying to achieve any goal I set out to achieve. Nothing I have was handed to me. I had to earn it and I continue to do so every day.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personal claim to fame: </strong><br/>
Getting into law school, making it through, passing the bar and excelling as a prosecutor. I did all of this while also getting married and starting a family. Within a six-year time span, I was married, graduated undergrad, started law school, had my first child, passed the bar, was hired as a prosecutor, and had my second child.
</p>
<p>
I recently had a trial in which the jury gave me a round of applause when it was completed. The presiding judge later told me he had never seen a prosecutor get a round of applauseâand he has been on the bench for over 20 years. That moment was confirmation that the lack of sleep, long hours, hard work, and mental strain were all truly worth enduring.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Inspiration in life:</strong><br/>
My dad. He was born to be a farm hand and his upbringing was extremely difficult. He is truly dedicated to his family and has a spirit and will thatâs indescribable.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? </strong><br/>
Lip balm because it travels everywhere with me. Champagne and salt and vinegar chips, which I am lumping into one item because they always go together. Pictures of my family for inspiration and a reminder of what truly matters.

Her early life struggles are very similar to my own. This caused both of us to develop a resilient personality, the ability to push ourselves, and never give up. This, along with our strong desire to help our families, gave us what many people lackâdrive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>:</strong><br/>
My life is like that set of stairs in the movie <em>Labyrinth</em>: the directions don't make sense nor does the order, but I always manage to find my way through and get where I want to go. For me, those stairs never stop. My motivation comes from within and I will never be done or satisfied.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
My job requires me to be a great storyteller and I have the burden to prove my case to a jury, which I welcome every time. That burden comes with a significant amount of responsibility and pressure. I must convince a jury of 12 people that the evidence presented and the case I put forth proves the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. No matter the situation or circumstances, I must maintain my composure, all the while focusing on obtaining the right result. That is the essence of <em>Survivor</em>.

<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Determined, intelligent, and funny.

<strong>Pet peeves:</strong> I don't like when people make plans or say theyâre going to do something and they don't deliver.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What does it mean to be a Millennial?</strong><br/>
Millennial means âfreedomâ to me. I say this because we are born in a time when anything is truly possible; social media and all these different outlets help you to not only learn information quickly, but gives you the capability to become or create anything. Being a Millennial, you can chase your dreams and do things that are out-of-the-box; as long as you are working towards your dream and not just sitting there thinking about it, you can become successful.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personal claim to fame:</strong><br/>
Purchasing my house at the age of 25.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Inspiration in life: </strong><br/>
I would definitely have to say my beautiful mother is my hero. Through everythingâincluding past divorces and serious health issuesâshe still pushes forward like the little Peruvian soldier she is. Sheâs had 10 brain aneurisms and received surgical care for six of them. She wakes up every day smiling and not only motivates and inspires me, but everyone she comes in contact with. I am truly blessed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? </strong><br/>
iPod because I'm always dancing or jamming out to something; a skimboard just in case there are some waves to ride; and a DVD player with DVDs, so I can lie back and relax after my hard day of living life like a caveman.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>: </strong><br/>
Sometimes I take the things for granted and I would like to strip myself of all the comforts. I want to go out there and play this game and win.

<p>
<strong>What does it mean to be a Gen-Xer? </strong><br/>
I grew up a latchkey kid with very little parental supervision. My parents both worked so my siblings and I had a lot more responsibilities and were expected to fend for ourselves. We were extremely obedient because we knew our parents worked very hard and we did not want to disappoint them.
</p>
<p>
Trophies were earnedânot givenâjust for participating in sports. This is the case for most Gen-Xers, which is why we are more independent and results-oriented. We hate being micromanaged and expect people to have ""common sense."" We don't compliment every little thing; we only give praise when well deserved.

<strong>Name:</strong> Mari Takahashi<br/>
<strong>Age:</strong> 31<br/>
<strong>Current residence:</strong> Los Angeles, CA<br/>
<strong>Occupation:</strong> Gamer<br/>
<strong>Tribe Designation:</strong> Vanua (Millennials)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Three words to describe you: Courageous, adaptable, and calculating.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hobbies:</strong> Video games, rock climbing, and traveling.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Pet peeves:</strong> Stagnation and laziness.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personal claim to fame: </strong><br/>
Summiting Mount Kilimanjaro. More than just the accomplishment of climbing a 19,000-foot mountain, it marked my transition from the world I knew everything about, which was the ballet world I dedicated 25 years to, and walking into the unknown, which led me to playing video games for a living.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Inspiration in life:</strong><br/>
[Facebook Chief Operating Officer] Sheryl Sandberg because she's been a huge inspiration to me and has had a huge impact on the way I've moved up in the industry.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? </strong><br/>
My journal and a writing tool; my iPhone with wi-fi, so I could Instagram the crap out of the beautiful location; a taco truck endlessly stocked with carne asada tacos, Mexican Coca-Colas and chocolate-covered churros.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Survivor</em> contestant you're most like:</strong><br/>
I'd like to play like <a href=""http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/20404/"" target=""_blank"">Yul Kwon</a> (<em><a href=""http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/video/yfEWht4npKPMQS4kpbbl_ci5ChGKhtUn/survivor-cook-islands-i-can-forgive-her-but-i-don-t-have-to-because-she-screwed-with-my-chickens/"" target=""_blank"">Cook Islands</a></em>). He was fiercely smart and two steps ahead of everyone the entire game. To be in so much control as to not have to play his idol at all was awesome. I'd also like to keep in mind <a href=""http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/215118"" target=""_blank"">Kelley Wentworth</a>âs (<a href=""http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/video/2D799CB8-EE25-206D-71E5-A487C25E5B9F/survivor-san-juan-del-sur-suck-it-up-and-survive/"" target=""_blank""><em>San Juan del Sur</em></a>, <a href=""http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/video/AD82FFBC-6BAB-48D6-53F7-F72D33B6FAB9/survivor-second-chance-a-second-chance/"" target=""_blank""><em>Cambodia</em></a>) gameplay in Second Chance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>: </strong><br/>
First, for glory. I love to win. I want to win <em>Survivor</em>. I'm a natural-born competitor and I will play hard because I want that W. To be able to say I've conquered 39 days of mental and physical mayhem and came out on top would be the biggest win for me. I would wear that title so proudly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>? </strong><br/>
I am tenacious. I love winning. I play to win. I compete every single day. Video games keep my mind sharp, my hand-eye coordination on point, and constantly hungry to get that W.
</p>
<p>
A background in ballet will shatter everyone else's chance of dominating in any balance challenge. My social game is calculated and precise. Social strategy is what I do. One doesn't accrue over 35 million fans across the internet by chance; it's strategic, calculated, technical, smart, and is exactly how I will play and win Survivor.

Michaela Bradshaw,33,"<div class=""cast-bio"" id=""js-character-copy""><p>
<strong>Name:</strong> Michaela Bradshaw<br/>
<strong>Age:</strong> 25<br/>
<strong>Current residence:</strong> Fort Worth, TX<br/>
<strong>Occupation:</strong> Vacation club sales<br/>
<strong>Tribe designation:</strong> Vanua (Millennials)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Three words to describe you: </strong>Intelligent, fun, and competitive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hobbies:</strong> Traveling, eating, and cuddling.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Pet peeves:</strong> When incompetent people try to instruct me, when people do things inefficiently or wrong, when I lose, and when other people make me lose.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What does it mean to be a Millennial? </strong><br/>
To be a Millennial is to resonate with the idea that I can design my own life. Itâs the notion that I should have the desires of my heart, not because I am ""entitled"" to them, but because God granted me the ability to attain them.
</p>
<p>
Being a Millennial means I am bold enough to state a want and stubborn enough to work for it, despite obstacles and the opinions of others. It means that my journey is only a failure if I stop moving forward.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personal claim to fame</strong>:<br/>
Paying off my student loan debt is the crowning achievement of my twenties thus far. As a low-income student at a pricey suburban university, I worked two to three jobs during the majority of my college career, had very little fun, and made every decision based on money.
</p>
<p>
When I graduated and began working as an admission counselor, I kept my expenses low by eating PB&amp;J for lunch, denying myself cable and internet, sticking to my flip phone, and driving my 1992 Honda Accord. After years of being teased for my frugal ways, I got the last laugh when I paid off $31,000 in loans at the age of 23.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Inspiration in life:</strong><br/>
My godfather is my hero. He was about 60 years old when I was born. He had no children of his own and was the ultimate father figure in my life. For 20 years, he has read the Bible every day.
</p>
<p>
When I was younger, he took care of me, showed me what to value in a man, and raised me to tell the truth, trust in God, be confident in myself, do my best, and not fear mistakes. His influence led me to be a magna cum laude college graduate. The person I am is because of him.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
A mirror because I'll feel better if I can look better and Iâll have no idea how I look if I can't see myself. A book because it will give me something to listen to besides myself and keep my mind sharp. Being alone and thinking too much drives people crazy. Finally, chocolate because sometimes a taste of something sweet can boost my mood.
</p>

Tasha was in the right alliances and never had her loyalty questioned. I love that Wentworth was crafty, played hard, took risks, and was an asset in challenges. Natalie represents my inner beast; she was athletic, spunky, played a social game, made big moves, and actually won.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>: </strong><br/>
My motivation is the $1 million. My goal is to leave an inheritance to my children's children. Winning <em>Survivor</em> would be a start.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I will be the Sole <em>Survivor</em> because I will adapt to everything the game throws at me. My experience in sales has made me nearly immune to rejection, so things not going my way won't take my head out of the game. Physically, Iâm in great shape. Also, Iâm a fairly rational thinker, so I will separate what I do in real life from what I need to do to win this game.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Pet peeves:</strong> Windshield wipers on a dry window.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What does it mean to be a Millennial?</strong><br/>
Being a Millennial means I can think outside the box. It means I won't settle for mediocrity but, rather, strive for the best outcome. It also means I know what a hashtag is and how to fix just about anything using YouTube or Google.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personal claim to fame: </strong><br/>
Travelling two months in Europe by myself for less than $3000âincluding airfare!âor winning two state cross-country championships.

<strong>Inspiration in life: </strong><br/>
Can I say God? He created everything we've ever seen, touched, and experienced. He knows everything there is to know about everything... because he created it. He must be big, intelligent, majestic, and awesome.

<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why? </strong><br/>
A good book to stimulate me mentally, spiritually, philosophically; waterproof mascara because I want to stay hot, especially on TV; and a large comfy bed.

<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Energetic, authentic, and fun!

<strong>Hobbies:</strong> Dancing, traveling, and high- ropes or high-adventure activities.

<strong>Pet peeves:</strong> I guess I would say bad manners.

<strong>What does it mean to be a Gen-Xer? </strong><br/>
We used to be viewed as the slackers until Millennials came along. Kidding. Gen-Xers are hard workers; however, I value what every generation brings to the table.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personal claim to fame:</strong><br/>
Sharing my raw story of the tragedies I've been through in a book in order to help others; although, I was scared to because I was so vulnerable.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Inspiration in life: </strong><br/>
My father because he has great values, is loyal, authentic, and has integrity. He is my hero! Growing up as a child, it was Harriet Tubman because she was courageous, bold, and risked her life to save others.

<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Bossy, compassionate, and tenacious.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hobbies:</strong> Repurposing and painting furniture, interior design, and thrift shopping because I love the thrill of the hunt for a good deal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Pet peeves:</strong> Arrogant people and those who think theyâre God's gift to the human race. Catty women who make the snide comments, back-handed compliments, and make other girls in the room feel like they don't measure up. Plus, people who are late drive me nuts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What does it mean to be a Gen-Xer?</strong><br/>
For myself, being a Gen-Xer means being driven and hard working. We don't expect things to be handed to us; we set goals and work hard for what we want in life. We also don't think we deserve to win in every situation and actually look at failure as an opportunity to learn. On the other hand, Gen- Xers can be stuck in our ways and leery of new ideas. It would help a lot if we would learn to listen to the younger generation and run with some of their new ideas.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personal claim to fame: </strong><br/>
Besides my four amazing kids, I'm most proud of being a breast cancer survivor. After five surgeries, eight rounds of chemotherapy, and 28 days of radiationânot to mention the horrible meds they put you onâI'm still here! It was important to me that my kids saw me as a ""warrior,"" rather than as a whiner. Of course, it was hard, but I wouldn't let cancer take over my life. Because of my faith, I was able to kick cancer's butt!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Inspiration in life: </strong><br/>
My inspiration comes from my relationship with the Lord. My faith has shaped my attitude in life and has given me the ability to be genuinely happy. Aside from my faith, my mom is my hero. She is the toughest lady. I get my tenacity and ""never quit"" attitude from her. I've watched her succeed despite her difficult upbringing, dealing with me and my brothers as teenagers, and enduring a bone-marrow transplant. No matter what happens, she keeps getting back up and going again!
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
A deck of cards because I love playing games and it helps break down walls with people you don't know; lip gloss because I always feel a little better about myself with a little color on my lips; and '80s music because I love singing with friends and, no matter how off-key you all are, it's always fun.

I see a lot of myself in her. Not only has she been through difficult times, but her faith stayed intact. We're both moms and I see myself ""mothering"" some of the younger players, as she did.

I know there will come a point I will have to deceive to get ahead; I plan to do it in the context of the game.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>: </strong><br/>
My primary motivation is of course a $1 million! Second, I want to prove to myself that I can do it.

I believe my strong personality will keep me going on the island. I know I'm good with people, especially young people because I work with them for a living, and this will help me gain allies on my tribe. My leadership skills will be useful in getting work done around camp.

However, I do respect <a href=""http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/39404/"" target=""_blank"">Randy Bailey</a> (<a href=""http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/video/4_vHAw486w2hSnFBkkCTsrXPg_BOFvln/survivor-gabon-want-to-see-the-elephant-dung-/"" target=""_blank""><em>Gabon</em></a>, <a href=""http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/video/aFRclVSLvwPGN8f8K4oYIShQzQm2akEr/survivor-heroes-vs-villains-slay-everyone-trust-no-one/"" target=""_blank""><em>Heroes vs. Villains</em></a>).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Reason for being on </strong><em><strong>Survivo</strong>r</em>:<br/>
My primary motivation is to show people that, even though I'm young, I can do anything an older person can do and more. People don't respect youth and I'm going to make them regret that. My secondary motivation is to screw with people's heads and lie every chance I get. It just sounds like fun.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>? </strong><br/>
I have a way of making people feel comfortable. I can manipulate people into thinking they are in control when, really, Iâm the one making the big moves necessary to win.

<strong>Name:</strong> Zeke Smith<br/>
<strong>Age:</strong> 28<br/>
<strong>Current residence:</strong> Brooklyn, NY<br/>
<strong>Occupation:</strong> Asset manager<br/>
<strong>Tribe designation:</strong> Vanua (Millennials)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Sharp, devilish, and unstoppable.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hobbies:</strong> Writing, improv, gym, and cooking.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Pet peeves:</strong> Sniffling.Â Chewing with one's mouth open.Â Black shoes with brown belts.Â Children who don't listen to their mothers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What does it mean to be a Millennial? </strong><br/>
To be perfectly honest, I've never thought of myself as a Millennial. Ask one of the other children.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personal claim to fame: </strong><br/>
Being ranked one of the Top 16 high-school debaters in the country my senior year of high school. I got a plaque. It's been downhill ever since.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Inspiration in life:</strong><br/>
Joan Rivers. She told Helen Keller jokes into her eighties. The woman lived.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
1. Hairspray: ostensibly for applicationsÂ in fire making, butÂ actually to keep my hair high and tight.<br/>
2. Coffee: toÂ calmÂ the nerves and awakenÂ the senses, so to be on alert for plots against me. Coffee treatments also bring out my hair's natural shimmer.<br/>
3. Industrial-sized vat of peanut butter: who wouldn't bring a high-protein, high-fat, delicious treat to a starvation marathon? And, lest we forget, peanut butter is a magnificent deep conditioner.

I mean, I'm not personally like a cop from New Jersey.Â I would never live in New Jersey, are you kidding me? Excuse me? New Jersey?Â Where Tony and I intersect is our unbridled passion for <em>Survivor</em>. I came to lie, manipulate, and make big moves, which, on Day 39, will leave no one doubting that I played the superior game. Seriously, New Jersey?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>: </strong><br/>
I love <em>Survivor</em>! I've dreamed of starving on desert beaches and running around in my unwashed underwear for years! It's long been my desire for <a href=""http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/215180/?pg=1"" target=""_blank"">Jeff Probst</a> to reward my mastery of lying and manipulation with $1 million dollars.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I'm tough as nails. Try and tear me down. Furthermore, people fascinate me. I can get along with anyone because I tend to be more curious than judgmental of an individual's quirks than judgmental. I'm surprisingly adept in the out-of-doors and have been killing myself in the gym for the past six months, so I shouldn't drag ass in challenges. Hopefully, all those hours... okay, days.... fine, years spent watching <em>Survivor</em> and listening to <em>Survivor</em> podcasts will yield at least some aptitude at the game.

</p>
<p>
<strong>How have you changed since the last time you played? </strong><br/>
Iâm older and wiser! I was only 21 the first time I played <em>Survivor</em> and then 23 during my second season. I definitely feel more confident as a person, so, hopefully this translates to the game and I'm not-so paranoid.
</p>
<p>
I'm also not so boy crazy, which is ideal!
</p>
<p>
<strong>What skills do you bring to <em>Survivor</em> that will make you a useful member of the group and what skills have you been learning since you last played? </strong><br/>
I'm confident in my challenge skills, so I know I'll be a great asset early on. After playing two seasons, I know how to work my social skills to form a solid group.
</p>
<p>
My biggest hurdle will be to not come across as a schemer. In <em>Caramoan</em>, I was constantly on the chopping block for that reason, so I've been coming up with strategies to avoid that.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What are you most proud of from the last time? </strong><br/>
I was pretty satisfied with my game in <em>Caramoan</em> for the reason that I was able to last as long as I did despite being high on the hit list of many people. I was also proud of myself for being able to laugh at being blindsided, and realize it's just a game.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What, if anything, do you most regret? </strong><br/>
Ha! There's a long list, but off the top of my head it would have to be finding myself in a <em>showmance</em> again! Not playing the Idol! Trusting Cochran!
</p>
<p>
<strong>How will you play differently this time? </strong><br/>
I will have to play a low-key aggressive game. I definitely tried to overcorrect my Redemption Island game by playing very aggressively in <em>Caramoan</em>, but I think everyone could see I was trying to ""make moves.""
</p>
<p>
I have to find some sort of balance between the two and also try to break away from my ""us vs. them"" old-fashioned way of playing the game. I have to be open to working with every single person.

</p>
<p>
<strong>How have you changed since the last time you played? </strong><br/>
Iâm more assertive, confident, and grounded in who I am. In my last season, I logically knew I could play and do well. This time, I believe it. I have an easier time taking stock of the cards on the table, making decisions, and rolling with the consequences.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What skills do you bring to <em>Survivor </em>that will make you a useful member of the group and what skills have you been learning since you last played? </strong><br/>
I bring the confidence in my physical abilities. In <em>KaÃ´h RÅng</em>, I proved I was a brain who could hang with brawn. I might not look athletic, but I am. Iâve been working on core strength and balance.
</p>
<p>
Emotionally, I'm more grounded than I was. I can be an attractive ally or confidant to other tribe mates, especially those on the outskirts, without letting those relationships drain me.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What are you most proud of from the last time?</strong><br/>
I am beyond proud that I made it to Day 39 despite encountering some obstacles, including:
</p>
<p>
- Having a horrendous Day 2.<br/>
- Crappily executing the Pete vote. This time, I'll be folding the paper up, eating it for fiber, and taking a new parchment if I change my mind.<br/>
- My infection.<br/>
- Two closest allies being medically evacuated.<br/>
- Being forced to make fire to save myself.
</p>
<p>
I managed some tough personalities and assembled a ragtag group to vote out Scot, which felt like dismantling a bomb, making sure all the wires were where they needed to be.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I may have bumped into more obstacles than a ball in a pinball machine, but I played proactively. I owned my actions and fate, and I did it in a way that was true to me.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What, if anything, do you most regret?</strong><br/>
I wish I could take back every second of every one of the five days I lived with Nick. Oh, and I regret letting Joe eat all the red meat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How would you play differently this time?</strong><br/>
Going into <em>Game Changers</em>, I know Iâll have a target on my back, especially since other players will have just seen my season. I canât play under the radarâ¦ people wonât buy it. I plan to align with a variety of people, including power players and villains to pad myself.
</p>
<p>
In Survivor 34, I will:
</p>
<p>
1. Do with certainty and apologize later.<br/>
2. Be friendly with more people and have intense relationships with less.<br/>
3. Execute with finesse.

<strong>Age</strong>: 25<br/>
<strong>Hometown</strong>: Fort Worth, TX<br/>
<strong>Previously played on</strong>: <a href=""http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/video/27A648A0-CE2E-8713-8253-495E83D4703F/survivor-millennials-vs-gen-x-may-the-best-generation-win/"" target=""_blank"">Season 33: <em>Millennials Vs. Gen X</em></a>, Finished 14th
</p>
<p>
<strong>How have you changed since the last time you played? </strong><br/>
Since <em>Millennials Vs. Gen X</em>, I've found it a lot easier to take action in the face of fear. After surviving loneliness, starvation, physical exhaustion, and exposure to the elements, I just can't allow silly things like âwhat-if"" scenarios to have control over me.
</p>
<p>
Also, I find that my reaction is to laugh at ridiculous things as opposed to becoming upset or angry. Whether itâs an annoying person, an unexpected delay, or a letdown of some sort, I just don't have the energy to be upset at anything that can't win me $1 million.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What skills do you bring to <em>Survivor</em> that will make you a useful member of the group and what skills have you been learning since you last played?</strong><br/>
I bring intelligence and realness to this game. In a game filled with paranoid people who thrive on deception, those qualities are a breath of fresh air to some.
</p>
<p>
Since <em>Millennials Vs. Gen X</em>, I've been learning how to hide what I'm thinking and what I'm capable of to some degree. I found out first hand that in a game for $1 million, no one wants to play with someone they think they can't beat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What are you most proud of from the last time?</strong><br/>
I'm most proud of the fact that I broke a lot of stereotypes. I was the woman who carried my tribe. I was the black girl who could swim and wasn't afraid to get her hair wet. I was the emotional one who could still make a logical decision. I was the ""athlete"" who was actually intelligent and articulate. I didn't fit in a box, and I liked that about myself.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What, if anything, do you most regret?</strong><br/>
I regret not understanding the importance of perception. What's real doesn't matter in this game. What people think and how they feel is what matters. My mistake in <em>Millennials Vs. Gen X</em> was not paying close enough attention to how others felt.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How will you play differently this time? </strong><br/>
I will play differently by monitoring how I am perceived. Instead of bucking the system, I'm going to ""play the game.""

<strong>How have you changed since the last time you played?Â </strong><br/>
Iâm back with a honed sense of self, a new passion for <em>Survivor</em>, and a vendetta from my wasted last game.Â 
</p>
<p>
<strong>What skills do you bring to <em>Survivor</em> that will make you a useful member of the group and what skills have you been learning since you last played?</strong>Â <br/>
I easily make strong social connections with many personality types, I'm resourceful and handy when it comes to living off the land, and I'm decently smart.Â

<p>
I'd say the most valuable skill I've learned since my last game is how to play <em>Survivor</em>. I've also become a bonafide criminal-defense attorney, which involves battling cop shenanigans on the daily, which I expect may be a thing in this game.Â

</p>
<p>
<strong>How have you changed since the last time you played? </strong><br/>
Iâm mentally stronger and more prepared to be a social person around my tribe in camp life and the game, in general. Iâm more aware that most castaways play this as a âgameâ and don't play it as real life, so I must adapt to that way of thinking.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What skills do you bring to <em>Survivor</em> that will make you a useful member of the group and what skills have you been learning since you last played?</strong><br/>
I've always been 100-percent a team player. And, I also think of myself as a great motivator with the people I'm around. I like taking the leader role in a low-key way.
</p>
<p>
Iâve lived my life as an adventure and Iâm extremely in touch with nature. Iâve been a jungle boy my whole life so fishing, fire-making, and shelter-building come very easily to me.
</p>
<p>
Also, I've been re-watching past <em>Survivor</em> seasons to pick up any clues I missed the first time around. I work my best to stay <em>young</em> at heart.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What are you most proud of from the last time? </strong><br/>
Iâm proud that I stayed true to myself. You pretty much saw 100-percent of me! I'm happy that everyone watching, including my tribe mates, got to see all my emotions. Whether I was laughing, smiling, carefree, kind-hearted, ecstatic, sympathetic, happy, sad, angry, irritated, heart-broke, or you name itâ¦ you got to see it all. All of Troyzan!
</p>
<p>
I'm also pretty proud of that fact that my rant of âThis is MY ISLAND!â is considered one of the 10 most memorable moments in <em>Survivor</em> history. I'll look back years from now and still laugh at that moment!
</p>
<p>
<strong>What, if anything, do you most regret? </strong><br/>
I regret that I didnât confront my enemies face to face more. I also would have called out Kim Spradlin (eventual winner of <em>Survivor: One World</em>) in front of the entire tribe daily!
</p>
<p>
I was putting too much thought into winning challenges as opposed to letting the tribe see the obvious plan Kim had. My mistake.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How will you play differently this time? </strong><br/>
Iâve realized this is an âoutwitâ game more than anything else. Iâll try to keep the bullseye off my back by not showing ALL my cards, like the last time I played.
</p>
<p>
And, at all costs, ALWAYS in ALL ways keep a person around whoâs a bigger target than myself. Keep your friends close and kiss your enemies!

<strong>How have you changed since the last time you played? </strong><br/>
Since I just played, I donât think Iâve changed at all. Iâm still digging sand out of my tush. I keep leaving the apartment barefoot. Iâve taken to sleeping on my neighbor's floor so thereâs someone to wake me during my night terrors. They know itâs time to shake me awake when I start screaming, âDave found another Idol!â
</p>
<p>
<strong>What skills do you bring to <em>Survivor </em>that will make you a useful member of the group and what skills have you been learning since you last played?</strong><br/>
New skills? Well, I went to a friendâs party in workout clothes. I brought my own salad, which I ate in a corner and refused to speak to anyone. So, yeah, I can do that now.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What are you most proud of from the last time? </strong><br/>
Iâm not quite sure. Itâs really all a blur. I remember something about forcing rocks to save myself. What, if anything, do you most regret? Nothing. Everything. Nothing. Everything. Chris.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How will you play differently this time? </strong><br/>
Frankly, I donât exactly know what I did right or wrong last time but, I think I played too flashy. This go âround, Iâm going to play more subtly, because Iâm a very subtle person.
</p>
<p>
Take one look at me and you think, âThis guy knows subtle. No part of his mustache or patterned shirts or style of speaking says, âpay attention to me!ââ

<p>
<strong>How have you changed since the last time you played? </strong><br/>
Iâm physically stronger, more aware, and better at reading people. Also, emotionally, I am less sensitive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What skills do you bring to <em>Survivor</em> that will make you a useful member of the group and what skills have you been learning since you last played?</strong><br/>
I can do anything outdoorsy! Iâm physically strong, loyal, easy to talk to, and people trust me. I am in better physical shape than I have ever been. I practice puzzles every day. Iâm mentally and physically ready.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What are you most proud of from the last time? </strong><br/>
My loyalty. I set aside pride and played the game. I am proud of my physical strength. I was a strong competitor in every challenge.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What, if anything, do you most regret?</strong><br/>
I regret not making a big move and to win, you have to. This time I am willing and ready to do whatever it takes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How will you play differently this time? </strong><br/>
Last time, I focused too much on my social game. I know itâs important, but I need to use the friendships I make to an advantage. I want to make big moves, blindsides, and do things that make me worthy to win. I am a physically strong competitor. I am bound and determined to win the Immunity necklace numerous times!

Iâve definitely been humbled. I have become a little more patient and I donât think Iâm quite as gullible.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What skills do you bring to <em>Survivor </em>that will make you a useful member of the group and what skills have you been learning since you last played? </strong><br/>
I think I bring many skills to the table. I will always play with all my heart, which has allowed me to overcome many obstacles in my life.
</p>
<p>
I plan to build a very strong team and lead them to the merge. From there, Iâll have to play with the hand I'm dealt to the best of my ability.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What are you most proud of from the last time? </strong><br/>
My ability to understand that I would have to make a big move to win the game and my guts to act on it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What, if anything, do you most regret? </strong><br/>
I most regret the moment I climbed down from the pole in the Immunity Challenge that led to my dismissal. I knew it would be hard to win, so I let myself climb down. If I hadnât climbed down, I could have held onto the pole for a lot longer.
</p>
<p>
I let myself take the easy way out, which is hardly ever the best decision. Hunger and conditions clouded my judgment without me recognizing it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How will you play differently this time? </strong><br/>
I will be more careful about picking my allies. More importantly, I will play a more aggressive Idol-tracking game, and a more determined and fierce challenge game.

</p>
<p>
<strong>How have you changed since the last time you played? </strong><br/>
After playing and watching my season unfold, I am more aware and appreciative of how complex <em>Survivor</em> is. I see my pitfalls and how I can improve. It's a delicate balance of being true to oneself and developing trust and friendships, while at the same time knowing who I think I can beat at the end.
</p>
<p>
I hope I have not become jaded or less trustful now. Each game is unique with its own dynamics and I just need to be open and see where it takes me. I need the knowledge from my past season, but not baggage.
</p>
<p>
<em>Survivor</em> is so great and winning is my ultimate goal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What skills do you bring to <em>Survivor</em> that will make you a useful member of the group and what skills have you been learning since you last played? </strong><br/>
I have proven that I work hard and am helpful around camp. I can start a fire and keep it going. I am resourceful and can forage and fish for food.
</p>
<p>
I am loyal, a nice guy, and get along well with everyone. I am pretty positive and can keep thing light and bring harmony to camp. I am small, but strong and would be good in team challenges.
</p>
<p>
Since the last time I played, I have been taking yoga to focus my mind and strengthen my core. I am also trying to improve my lousy hand and eye coordination by playing in a Bocce ball league.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What are you most proud of from the last time? </strong><br/>
Blindsiding Scot [and] Jason, and sending Scot home. I am proud that I broke away from their alliance to have a voice and played my own game. Deciding on my own destiny resulted in making the Final 3.
</p>
<p>
And, yes, I am so happy to have saved Mark, the chicken. I worked really hard foraging for food so others didn't eat him.
</p>
<p>
I am also proud to bring awareness to how we humans need to take care of our environment and have compassion for other living things.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What, if anything, do you most regret? </strong><br/>
I regret not managing the Jury better and not being able to articulate, own, and defend all that I accomplished during the game. I regret spending so much time and energy providing for camp which took me away from the game play.
</p>
<p>
Toward the end, I was completely depleted which affected how I played and performed at the final Tribal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How will you play differently this time? </strong><br/>
I am much more confident about the game now. I know I have a lot to offer and I can get along with everyone; now it's time to create strong relationships. It's good to have friends in both an alliance and on the Jury. I will be much more observant and aware of my position within the rest of the tribe.
</p>
<p>
I need to be more flexible and fluid in this ever-changing game of strategy, focusing on the bigger picture of winning the game rather than personal friendships. Most of all, I would like to be myself, take risks, and have fun hanging with all these big <em>Survivor</em> legends.

</p>
<p>
<strong>How have you changed since the last time you played? </strong><br/>
Iâm more physically fit, less emotional, and smarter. I'm still me and could pop off at any time without warning, but I'm focused on being calmer.
</p>
<p>
I'm honored to be part of this cast and aware this could be the last time I'm ever on a <em>Survivor</em> island, so I want to soak up the surroundings, beauty, and energy of being part of this landmark series.
</p>
<p>
I just played this game, so the excitement of being back is more tempered by a focus to not get too carried away.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What skills do you bring to <em>Survivor</em> that will make you a useful member of the group and what skills have you been learning since you last played?</strong><br/>
Iâll be much more useful at challenges and intend to be more instrumental around camp. I want strong relationships when this is over, but already have a host of great friends.
</p>
<p>
I make mistakes, but I'm a good person with a good heart. I hope America sees that. But if my competition doesn't, their loss.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What are you most proud of from the last time? </strong><br/>
Being chosen by America, by far! Also, my instinctual gameplay. My ability to control a volatile group of people and be the determining factor as to who went home on the first two boots.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What, if anything, do you most regret? </strong><br/>
Going too hard, too soon. Playing with too much emotion in the beginning. Drawing the Angkor buff. No matter how good of a game you're playing, drawing the wrong buff can change everything.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How will you play differently this time? </strong><br/>
I want to have more fun this time. Iâll combine my Outback and Cambodia stylesâhard gameplay with a more subtle approach. I plan to try and control my emotions more. As best as circumstances allow, Iâll manage a swap better.
</p>
<p>
I plan to align myself with the big threats. Even if I end up in the minority after a swap, I'll make sure there is someone else with me who is more of a target.
</p>
<p>
This time, itâs all business. I'd love to make the Jury finally, but if I don't, I want to make sure I've soaked it all up in a way that it's okay.

</p>
<p>
<strong>How have you changed since the last time you played?</strong><br/>
I'm older and much wiser. Just kidding. I'm older, but definitely <em>not</em> wiser. You will see the same guy in this season as you saw in Cagayan.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What skills do you bring to <em>Survivor</em> that will make you a useful member of the group and what skills have you been learning since you last played? </strong><br/>
Unfortunately, the skills I bring to <em>Survivor</em> are skills that will NOT make me a useful member. Instead, they will make me a very threatening member.
</p>
<p>
I haven't learned any new skills since I played on Cagayan, which could be my downfall going back on an all returnee season. I wish I could have learned the skill of being able to be quiet and try to play under the radar, but I don't see that happening. Itâs just not in my DNA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What are you most proud of from the last time? </strong><br/>
WINNING!!
</p>
<p>
<strong>What, if anything, do you most regret? </strong><br/>
There is seriously nothing I regret. Everything I did on Cagayan was on the fly. Some things were based off of emotion, some based off of strategy, but nothing was based off of malice.
</p>
<p>
In the end, it all fell into place and I became the Sole Survivor.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How will you play differently this time? </strong><br/>
Going into the game this time around, with all the players knowing my game style, I know that I'm going to be a huge threat. Having said that, I know I will have to take it down a few notches until I can plant my roots.
</p>
<p>
Knowing myself, I wonât be able to take it down any notches and will be in trouble. I hope I have what it takes to adapt right away and ""go with the flow""âif thatâs even possible for me to do.
</p>
<p>
I will have my fingers crossed for sure!

</p>
<p>
<strong>How have you changed since the last time you played? </strong><br/>
For all the magic and mystery in playing <em>Survivor</em>, I'm more patently aware of how people can see and hear the exact same event/conversation and have widely different opinions/reactions/interpretations of said event.
</p>
<p>
I'm making a concerted effort to view situations through other people's minds and eyes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What skills do you bring to <em>Survivor</em> that will make you a useful member of the group and what skills have you been learning since you last played?</strong><br/>
I'm a worker around camp and wasâand willâbe a contributor; do what you can to make camp as hospitable as it can be, given the savagery of the environment and the fierce competition. When it comes to voting someone out at Tribal, I want to keep in mind just one thing: any name but mine will do just fine.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What are you most proud of from the last time? </strong><br/>
For all its strange alchemy and upheavals of emotion, energy, and stomach, I enjoyed it all with exuberance and an ability to laugh and forgive myself and others.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What, if anything, do you most regret? </strong><br/>
Not making more of an effort to reach out to Scot and Jason. Everyone and anyone can be an ally, if only for one vote.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How will you play differently this time? </strong><br/>
Attempt to reach out to as many people as possible while still maintaining sincerity and decency. I know we are just playing a game, but attachments happen, and feelings really do get bruised.
</p>
<p>
If I'm going to lie, I hope not to be too much of a wanker about it. Keep the lines of communication open to all and try not to let slights, injustices, real or imagined, get to me.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps gain 10 lbs, as well; foraging for food often uses more energy than we got from finally eating it. <em>Survivor</em> is EXHAUSTING, mentally and physically, I'd like to keep a mental picture of many rescued animals, safe and happy, to remind me of why I'm playing again.

My parents. They are my best friends. I respect the both for their work ethic, and everything they instilled in me. My parents have been married for 30+ years and I know that takes work.<br/>

Hot sauce because it makes everything better, a picture of my wife because sometimes just looking at her changes my mood, and baby wipes!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
I honestly don't think you will see gameplay like mine; one of the only things I have in common with people on past seasons is there was a winner.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Playing football has fed my drive to compete physically for a long time. Of course there are mental aspects but I feel like this is competing mentally, physically, and strategically. I also want to win on my own meritâno coaches, no practiceâjust me winning outside of something I've done for years.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Everything I've accomplished I've had to scratch and claw at it. I've never been given anything or put in situations to succeed. My life has always been about proving people wrong and I feed on that, here is another shot.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
My hero is my dad. He has been there for me and has supported me through everything! He has never let me down. I value the consistency, candor, love, and honesty that he shows to me and others. He has always set a good example for me and he leads by his actions. I would not have gotten where I am today without him! I give him a lot of credit for who I am today! I am thankful God has blessed me with a wonderful father and a great family.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
Teriyaki Sauce. Everything tastes better with teriyaki sauce. Next would be Takis (hot chili and lime flavor) because they are amazing and finally a pen and pad to document each play that made me Sole Survivor.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
<a href=""http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/215017/"" target=""_blank"">Joe</a> from Season 30. He was a nice guy and knew how to use his social skills to make friends in the game. When he was backed against a wall, he fought as hard as he could to win every individual immunity and save himself. He wasn't a quitter and neither am I!
</p>
<p>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
My primary motivation is to win a million dollars! I'm a businessman and this is a business trip!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I believe that I can withstand the challenges in every facet. I can solve puzzles, work well with my team, strategize, and in most cases beat out my competitors with my endurance. I can take on the outdoor elements, I can fish, I can build a shelter, and probably start a fire. I am good at bonding with others and communicating to create friendship and strategies so that my team will not want to eliminate me. I will be too valuable to get rid of, but will not outperform to look like a threat.

<p>
<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong><br/>
Obtaining my doctorate in Nursing before the age of 28 and creating a health and wellness brand ""Belovist.""
</p>
<p>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
ClichÃ© â My parents. They both have devoted their lives to helping others. They have worked hard and excelled in education and careersâshowing me that hard work pays off. They have shown me what true love means as well as the value of family and having a relationship with Christ. Even in my adult life, I remember the wisdom and lessons they've taught me while growing up, and it keeps this scattered mind of mine on point! They are my biggest fans, and I am theirs.

<p>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I'm looking for the time of my life! Of course the money, adventure, and opportunities to challenge myself physically, emotionally, and spiritually in ways that I haven't been challenged before.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I am extremely physically and mentally resilient as well as disciplined. I am driven by failures, challenges, and goals.

In the same breath, my sanguine personality always stands out as being a super-social optimist, which will give me favor with the other players.

<p>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Real, confident, and energetic.

<p>
<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong><br/>

<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Mo money baby! Of course the million dollars. I play ""survivor"" 40 hours a week at work. It would take me 10 plus years to earn a million dollars at my current work rate. Why not speed up the process and make a million in six weeks? Itâs a no brainer. In addition, I always tell my son that he needs to give 100 percent in everything he does. I'm constantly telling him ""go hard or go home.""Â I just want him to see that what I preach, I also apply to myself.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I can relate to people from all paths of life, I work in a diverse community with diverse backgrounds in age, religion, and social status. I can converse with anyone about anything. With these stories, Iâll be able to manipulate individuals and my surroundings. I'm a likable, outspoken, and natural in most things I do. Nothing I do feels forced or uncomfortable. I'm well aware of my strengths and weaknesses. I'm not going to <em>Survivor</em> for vacation or fame. I'm not going to be away from my children for six weeks and come back empty handed. I can win this and I am confident I can.

<p>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Impressive, tough, and hilarious.

<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong><br/>
Just about as well rounded as any woman could be. I'll be just one of the guysâout saving lives, working out, and cracking jokes all day and then all of the sudden I can put myself together into a well-spoken lady who can charm your socks off and still kick butt.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
This whole world inspires me. Everywhere you look there is opportunity to make a change for the better and to really go out there and live the exact life you want to live. People get so caught up in the day to day that they forget that in each of us is the power to change. The way I see it, there's nothing stopping anyone who wants something bad enough from going out and making it happen; and if that thing doesn't work out, you learn, you grow, and you move on.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
A surfboard to keep me sane, headphones to tune out other people's complaining, and a journal to secretly document everything and tactically plan how to use it against others.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
<a href=""http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/20509/"" target=""_blank"">Richard Hatch</a> seemed to have the right idea, and because he won. I am a winner.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Life is WAY too short to not say YES to everything. My dad and I have wanted me to be on <em>Survivor</em> since Season 1âand I finally decided that I should stop messing around and go out and win a million bucks for myself and the family. I get super anxious when life starts to settle too much so I really needed another curve ball in life to mix things up a bit and this is certainly it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
If you're not first, you're lastâand I refuse to be last. I have never given up or settled for second best at anything in my life. I know that my body is capable of way more than the average human and mentally I have the strong will, stubbornness, and confidence to ensure that I will be there at the end. Being the Sole Survivor is what is meant for my life next.

<p>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>

<p>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Adventurous, tenacious, and charismatic.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong> Being a mother.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
I studied nonviolence and Gandhi while at UC Berkeley. I am inspired by how he was able to use nonviolent resistance in a positive way. His profound spirituality and belief in justice altered history. There are two powers: love and fear. I like to focus on the power of love.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
A journal so I could write, music to dance, sing, and have fun, and a picture and letter from my family to feel amazingly loved, as I also send them love daily.

<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
I am a more outgoing, adventurous <a href=""http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/159997/"" target=""_blank"">Denise Stapley</a>. Also, I can relate to the ones who are tough, athletic, and say it like it is, but also have a softness to them.

<p>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
TO WIN! To win the million dollars! I love to challenge myself, and allow my own intensity to thrive in a game like Survivor. I am also fascinated by human dynamics and what happens to people in these situations, and cannot wait to see how I handle it myself. I love seeing what I am made of.

<p>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Because I can win! I know how to win. Just like I went from farm town girl to Olympic swimmer (swam for the USA 1985-1991, and 1988 Olympics), I am tenacious and great at convincing others to support me. They feel good about themselves around me and value me, thus being okay with me being the winner.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Outgoing, adventurous, and easygoing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong><br/>
My daughter. She is determined, smart, and my driving force.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
My mother is my hero because I have seen her struggle my entire life to make sure that I had everything I needed. She has taught me to be a strong, independent woman with morals and a high determination to overcome any struggle that may come my way.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
First would be a picture of my daughter to have determination every day. Next would be a toothbrush because I want clean teeth. And finally, sunglasses for comfort since I wear them every day. I am in the sun all day and my eyes cannot take the constant exposure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
None of them. I always try to do things differently than other people.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I want to test myself and to see what I am made of after all of these years of having to survive for myself in real life. I would put my years of hard work to use. Also, getting to travel to exotic locations which is normally unattainable to me.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I have always been a survivor and everything I have obtained was through perseverance, personal risk (through all climate and weather conditions), hard work and working with the public. I have always put myself on the line and always will.

<p>
<strong>Pet peeves:</strong> Smoking, political correctness, and people who lack passion.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Witty, ambitious, and approachable.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong><br/>
I've worked a lot of jobs, but I am most proud of my internships with both houses of Congress, and the British Consulate. I also aspire to attend law school.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning is my inspiration in life. His toughness is admirable, as he has never missed a game in his entire NFL career. He has a humble demeanor, and always takes responsibility if the team loses. Even though he has won two Super Bowls, he is continually critiqued, yet always acts with grace and humility. Eli has honestly provided me with some of the best moments of my life, so take that for what it'sÂ worth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
First I would bring a sports visor which will block out the sun as well as allow the top of my head to get an Island breeze, a McDonald's Shamrock Shake because they are seasonal so any opportunity I have to get one, I have to take, and a podium so I could give press conferences to pretend people care about what I have to say.

<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
<a href=""http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/20288/"" target=""_blank"">Todd Herzog</a>, on <em>Survivor</em>: China, he had tremendous social skills and charisma; he was incredibly well-spoken and he was relatable enough to build bonds that lasted until the end. Similar to Todd, I think some of my abilities are underestimated by others.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I love the game. I have wanted to play this game since I was six years old. It's much more than a game to me, it's a passion, I obsess over it. Life does not give you many opportunities to test yourself like <em>Survivor</em> is designed to.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I feel like I can get along with a variety of different people because I have knowledge of different topics. Without question, I am there to win and I will use relationships to get to the end yet I will do it in a way that ensures I'm liked enough to get votes.

<p>
<strong>Hobbies:</strong> Traveling the world, participating in pageants, and going to the gym.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Pet peeves:</strong> I can't stand people who are all talk. I work my butt off every day so I have little patience for laziness. I expect to see results and have no problem calling someone out if they don't deliver.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Congenial, forthright, and unremitting.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong><br/>
I became an assistant professor at the age of 26 and a program director at the age of 27. They don't just hand out those titles to anyone.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
My grandmother. A survivor of the Great Depression, the civil right's movement, a divorce, and her second husband's fatal illness, she demonstrated unmatched resilience, resolve, and compassion. But above all, she played as hard as she worked and literally lived each day to the fullest. In honor of her legacy, I attempt to live my life without regrets.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong> First would be Chapstick because there's nothing sexy or seductive about cracked lips (arguably, this could be survival related since it would hinder my ability to seduce the opposite sex). Second would be an unlimited supply of food because I've seen the show and those people get hangry quick! Finally, a masseuse because I love being pampered.
</p>

<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
<a href=""http://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/214793/"" target=""_blank"">Tasha</a> from Season 28. Though Tasha was casted for the ""brains""Â tribe, she had the social skills of the beauty tribe and certainly the strength of the brawn tribe. She played a good game and was undoubtedly a fierce, physical competitor. I was able to relate to Tasha because I also think I'll be a physical, social, and cognitive threat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Winning one million dollars! Professionally and personally, I don't love where I am and would be so grateful for a clear path out. I've also told the people close to me that I'd love to spend some time living out of a backpack, traveling, and showering only a few times a week...Â so being on <em>Survivor</em> would be a dream come true.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Charm, wit, beauty, mental fortitude, physical strengthâall of these traits and more will ensure I'm the Sole Survivor. Already in good shape, I will show up on the island the strongest, quickest, most powerful and agile I've ever been. Borrowing from my childhood love of puzzles and games or logic and strategy, my mental sharpness will be at its peak. A natural academician, I will arrive having not only watched, but studied the game. If you combine those traits with my will to win and my expertise in gaining feigned camaraderie, I'm nearly unbeatable.

<strong>Hobbies:</strong> Crossfit, poker, and skiing.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Pet peeves:</strong> Fake people, small talk at parties, and judgmental people who are convinced they are better than me.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Calculated, intuitive, and empathetic.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong><br/>
My greatest personal accomplishment came when my first daughter was born in 2008. Before her birth I was very overweight, smoked cigarettes, dabbled quite a bit at the craps table and would most likely be sitting down at the poker table on any given day. I recall a specific moment when my daughter was about a year old and she wanted me to take her outside on the swings. It was chilly that day so I had to dress warm. While putting on my shoes, I recall panting from being out of breath from the simple act of tying my own shoes.<br/>
<br/>
It was at that moment that I knew I had to make a change so that I would be around a long time for her and my other children that were soon to come. In the last seven years, I quit smoking, dropped 65 pounds and even though I can still occasionally be found in a poker room, I have dramatically prioritized where my income goes and where most of my money is spent, which is primarily bills and workout clothes for my wife.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
My father. He raised nine kids on a construction salary, taught his boys to be men and his daughters to be ladies.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
A photo of my wife, a picture of my rugrats because they're awesome, and an antihistamine, which I will spike in somebody's drinking water if they are relentlessly annoying me and/or the group on the island.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
I know you are looking for one, but I am going to split this in three. Mostly Cirie, because I think she is masterfully empathetic with other players. She has an amazing ability to disable people. I hope I can do what she has done in the game. Second is Cochran. He wins in the emotional intelligence category that allows him to morph into whatever he needs to at the time. He also understands the importance of stroking other people's egos when he needs to. This is something I hope I am capable of doing. And finally Rob Mariano, for the simple fact that we both come from Italian families with a background in construction. But more importantly, he sees the game big picture which is critical and I hope I can maintain.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Obviously this is the opportunity of a lifetime to play this game, but this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to take a forced break from real life. And I don't mean that I am happy to leave my family or my job, but this game will force me to be away from my life for a set period of time which I hope will open my eyes to what's important when I get home. Oh yeah, and that money is mine!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I grew up in a house with eight siblings. Lack of food, clothes, and showers are something I'm accustomed to. This game should be a walk in the park.

<strong>Pet peeves:</strong> Complaining.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Unbreakable, driven, and real.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong><br/>
Getting a place and back on my feet after being homeless. Freshman year when school ended, I didn't have anywhere to go. My parents were in Nigeria and both my brothers were in the U.S. but not much older than me so they couldn't help. This resulted in me being homeless for 1-2 months.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
BeyoncÃ©. She works so hard and is constantly topping herself. She literally sets the standard for every performer and artist and continues to raise the bar. She had Adele and Kanye West on stage defending her when she didn't win an award. Who else can do that? She is one of the few super humans to walk the Earth.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
A picture of a skeleton in a grave to constantly remind me that things could be worse, a photo book of my family because I will always love them and they forever motivate me and finally, text message threads between me and my best friend. We have the funniest conversations and laughing is the best way to stay positive and happy.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
Michaela! I am a strong black woman who is not afraid to make power moves. I haven't had an easy life and sure as hell don't expect winning <em>Survivor</em> to come easy. I relate a lot to her because we are both strong-willed and determined and willing to do what it takes to accomplish our goals.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
The million dollars would change my life drastically. I would have a story for the booksâthe girl that went from village to Versailles. I've seen it all, from the slums to the fast-paced, hard working student life in NYC. I want to change my life and my surroundings. I want to show myself and others that regardless of what you've been through, (it was being homeless for me), you can succeed.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I currently live in a house of eight girls. I know how to deal with seven different versions of crazy and different personalities. I am constantly settling issues in the house and running the house meetings, not only does this make me sociable, it makes me likable and adaptable. I have good experience in sports, having played basketball for most of high school and I work out at my college gym. I'm putting myself through school with grants and academic scholarships while my parents are in Nigeria and I am an asset to any team.

My ever-evolving career. From being a waitress in Indiana, working at a plant nursery in Florida, to a receptionist at a crematory, and eventually working in career services and business consulting with a dual MBA and Master of Public Health.<br/>
<br/>

My parents. My dad is one of the hardest working people I know. My mom tutors incarcerated women, volunteers on Election Day, and contributes to our local community in a loving, selfless way.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
A bag of Skittles. I'm addicted to candy and just one Skittle a day would keep me going through starvation! Next, a deck of cards so I could get people to play games that require deceit, and try to read tells, and tampons, because, duh.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
I hope I'm a mix between Kelley Wentworth and Aubry Bracco. Kelley is a badass game player who would do anything to win. She gets people to trust her and is still a snake. I'm also a little bit Aubryâstrategic, very intuitive, but slightly neurotic and quirky.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
As Probst says, <em>Survivor</em> is a human experiment. I am fascinated, as a huge fan, to watch how people interact and deceive when pushed to their limits. Can't wait to have a front row seat! I want to prove to myself that I can take on this insane physical and mental challenge. <em>Survivor</em> is the greatest game on earth, and I'd like to try my hand at it.<br/>

First, lemons to flavor my water/food and bleach my hair. Second would be Mentos gum to chew, and finally, pen and paper to document my journey/write love letters to a hot castaway.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Because why the hell not? Literally can't think of a single reason why anyone would say no to an experience of a lifetime. Life is too short to not say ""YES.""<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I have been able to manifest anything and everything I've ever wanted in my lifeâit's pretty cool. Not to brag, but I say I want something and I always get it. So hopefully by saying ""I'll survive,"" I will win or at least come out of the experience with nothing but a profound appreciation of what I just accomplished.

<strong>Occupation:</strong> Music Teacher<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Hobbies:</strong> Songwriting and performing those songs, telling storiesâbe that on stage or just to friendsâand cooking with my mom. Shut up, it makes me happy! Also, I listen to a ton of podcasts, attend as many concerts as I possibly can, and spend a great deal of time panicking over current political events.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Pet peeves: </strong>When people let little discomforts spoil an entire experience. When people feel a need to complain constantly, even when there's nothing to complain about. The worst, though? When people don't have a sense of humor. Laugh, dammit!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Self-deprecating, charming, and affableâthough others would say ""punchable.""<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong><br/>
Nothing feels better than hearing your own music for the millionth time and still enjoying it. And even better, when other people hear your music for the first time and it makes them cry. You can't fake those kinds of responses. It's the best. Cheesy? Maybe. True? You bet, man.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
I have a few but I suppose Robin Williams is the most well-known one. When I was a little kid, Genie from <em>Aladdin</em> was my entire sense of humor. That wild, a-hundred-jokes-a-minute pacing, all the voices and wackiness completely dazzled me. As I got older, I got to appreciate all his other amazing roles and unabashedly nutty stand-up routines. I'm often told I'm too loud. I blame that entirely on Robin Williams.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
First would be my guitar because it gives me something I can focus on outside of the game. Next, one of those daily joke calendars because not only is it great for keeping track of time, but if your situation isn't providing many laughs, it's good to have a reliable way to find some. Finally, beard oil. I bought my first vile of this stuff about a year ago and it's the best feeling thing ever. Plus, it's really fun to respond to ""Are you wearing cologne?"" with ""No, just beard oil.""<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
I've always felt like I related most to Stephen Fishbach, though I see a lot of David Wright in me as well. I'm a funny, nerdy, neurotic Jewish guy trying to make it in the entertainment business. I'm logical and smart (I like to think), but I've spent plenty of time crying in private.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I've been dreaming of doing this for well over a decade. At this point, above all else, it's to prove I can do what I've been saying I could do since I was a kid: Win <em>Survivor</em>. Part pride, part sticking it to the kids who tortured me growing up. It's a ""What have you accomplished?"" kind of thing. I promise I'm not usually so vengeful!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
This sounds stupid, but I'm really easy to talk to. I want to set up my situation so everyone knows they can come to me to chat and get support despite any problems they're having personally or socially in the game. I'm a teddy bear, y'know? On top of that, I'm not a weakling. I can haul firewood and follow instructions when it comes to building shelters. I know how to make fire and untie knots and all that.

<br/>
<strong>Pet peeves:</strong> Complainers! People who feel entitled to everything without working for it. Also, annoying laughs, arrogant men, racism, bullies, and pretty boys.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Three words to describe you: </strong>Outspoken, strong-willed, and strategic.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong><br/>
I was promoted to Senior Surgery Technician after only one year of long hours and sleepless nights of on call emergency surgeries. Meanwhile I was taking care of 14 foaling babies (horses) at home in exchange for rent.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
Not to be the clichÃ© but my mother, reasons being I would not be here if she decided to abort (which was highly recommended by her doctors due to health issues when pregnant with me), Thanks for rebelling Mom! I am grateful for the woman she is and instilling in me the fighter I've become. She recently overcame skin cancer with a smile on her face. She's had to work hard and reconstruct her life after some health issues and losing close family members. She is a genuinely kind, graceful woman with fire in her heart. She works with handicapped children which has been a dream of hers. She reminds me I have a bigger purpose in life.<br/>
<br/>
I've always really appreciated her strong support in my way of thinking and encouraged me to keep being an extraordinary human being. In other words, having a strong personality and being weird is cool in her book. That normal is boring and with that, normal woman rarely go down in history. To always do everything in life wholeheartedly. It's an ""all or nothing"" kind of life in my mom's eyes. I couldn't agree more with that woman.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
A small plush panda teddy bear my mom gave me. It's special because she calls it my guardian angel. It really is the little things in life. A small bottle of my dad's cologne. He is the one who always pushes me to do better than the best, to be tougher. Being able to smell his cologne will feel like he is right next to me talking words of wisdom and encouragement. I was always a daddy's girl, and most importantly I have this bracelet that says ""ONE MILLION WIN"" (cause Sole Survivor would be a bit too cheesy even for me). It's gold on black strings and it serves as my reminder of how bad I need to win Sole Survivor. I never take it off.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
I would play like a combination of people. First would be Tony Vlachos who actually goes out and hunts for idols when no one's paying attention. Next would be to play challenges like challenge beast Kelly Wiglesworth. I'm also going to go for a nice little four win streak. Also, Brenda Lowe who can't help but be expressive, kind but is a total badass in challenges, and finally, Sandra who I can identify with socially in her sassy attitude and manipulative ways.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
One million dollars is a huge motivating factor for me. The bragging right of forever being a legendary Sole Survivor and being 1 of 16 women to win will be nothing short of amazing, but a million dollars is life changing! It would give me the freedom to be able to have a home and not continue to move from crappy apartment to crappy apartment. It would allow me to pursue investing and financial growth which I can turn into my lifelong goal of living a philanthropic life.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Because of my hell-bent determination and strong will to win. I put my heart into everything I do. I wanted to go to school, so I worked three jobs to pay for it, along with 1,000 hours of internships to graduate. In business I wanted to help my brother and we grew the business from one store to three stores. I know in my heart that I can win. I welcome all challenges with open arms and can read people really well.<br/>
<br/>
Socially, it'll be fun to test waters on how diverse I can be in order to really connect with people. After all, I have to cater to people's personalities so they'll feel comfortable doing what I need. Once my heart is set I will stop at nothing until I've achieved my goal even through blood, sweat, and tears. I've studied <em>Survivor</em> well enough to understand how to manipulate the numbers, play idols how they should be played and hustle the social game. I will go into this with focus, agility, and perseverance.

My family. I'd do anything for them or to make their lives better.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why</strong>?<br/>
First, my brush to take care of my beautiful beard and fro. Second, a chainsaw so I can make building things a lot easier, and finally, a sketchbook so I can doodle, draw, and write.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
I think I'd play the game like Jeremy Collins because I'll always keep my heart in the right place, but I'll still be a serious competitor and threat.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I've been a big fan for a while, and I've always wanted to push myself to the limits and see if I can really survive. Oh yeah, I'm playing for the million bucks, too. That would really help things.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I'm good with people and likable. I'm very diplomatic and can connect with people from different walks of life. I'm also not the biggest and strongest looking person, though I can compete with the best of them. That will get me past the first few votes. Then, my athleticism and skill at puzzles will help me win challenges when it becomes an individual game. Finally, my persuasive skills in front of a jury will win me the million. Boom.

It is D-O-N-A-T-H-A-N, not Jonathan or Donovan.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Determined, whimsical, and rare.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong><br/>
I was a part of a national and state level winning dance team. I danced in the hip-hop routine. I am proud of being openly gay and dancing in front of thousands in this area. My goal is always to try to change the opinions of others when it comes to the LGBTQ community and through dancing, I was able to open the arms of many.<br/>
<br/>
There will never be another me when it comes to those years and for that impact, I feel very accomplished. Being the only guy to hold a national championship among the basketball, football and baseball guysâyeah, that felt really nice!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
My hero is my grandmother, Deloris Bentley. Always has been, always will be. My grandmother had seven children between the years of 1960-1968, with my mom being the youngest. She raised them all with very limited food, no power until 1975, no bathrooms, only outhousesâall while dealing with the day-to-day struggles of having an alcoholic as a husband.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years, things got better for her. She raised her children, divorced and re-married (twice), and ended up being very independent and open-minded! In 2006, she had a brain aneurysm. She flew out to have emergency surgery and you know what saved her that time? Her blood was so thick from smoking three packs a day for so many years, that the aneurysm was sealed shut.<br/>
<br/>
After her surgery, she was up the next morning eating on some ice. Now if that isn't inspiring, I don't know what is! She has always been the glue in our family. She is such a hero in my eyes because of all the sacrifices, determination and selflessness she has expressed and shown all her life! Many people are probably picking celebrities and all that jazz, but my little 'ole Maw Maw is my hero.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
My cross necklace my grandmother got for me, my glasses (if that counts) so I can snap them in half to help with making fire, and just the clothes on my back.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
While there are tons of castaways that I have related to, especially those from the LGBTQ community (Colton, Todd, Tia), and my hillbillies (Keith, Sandy, JT), I always find the most relatable to be Cirie.<br/>
<br/>
No one expected the gameplay Cirie played in her first season. She went out there, hated leaves, and really didn't know much about the game. But you know what? She went out there and learned the way. She kept her mouth shut when need be, made the big moves when she needed to, and had a great sense of the people on the island what they were thinking.<br/>
<br/>
She is the type of player I see myself being. I adore her, and it doesn't hurt that her birthday is July 18th and mine July 19th. We Cancers just have a way about us that is charming, yet manipulative. Our knife is always ready for backs (figuratively)!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
It's for me and my family. We have always been below the poverty line. We have always struggled year to year to make ends meet. But it does make you stronger having to live that way. But you know what? I am tired of living this life.<br/>
<br/>
I want to be a great influence for my familyâprove to them that when you try, things can happen. It takes you to put the first foot in the door, no one else. I don't want to end up being stuck here in a rusted old trailer. I want more for my family, especially my mom and grandmother, and also help those in my area who are less fortunate.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Living in Eastern Kentucky has its perks. We are outdoors people. We love the lakes, we love to roam trails and mountains, and I have learned a lot about nature and survival. And while I have never been in a dire situation to use these skills, I truly believe when the survivalist in me kicks in, I would have a lot to offer.<br/>
<br/>
Now darlin', I ain't no lumberjack. But I can offer common sense solutions in order to help make my tribe grow. I already plan on breaking my glasses to help with fire and prove that this little gay hillbilly nerd isn't afraid of what nature can bring! I really think I will surprise a lot of people.

<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong><br/>
My college volleyball team winning our division championship. It's one thing to compete at the highest level, but it's another to win and be the best at it.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
My parentsâfor their dedication, support, and all the values they instilled in me.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
Crossword puzzle book to keep my mind sharp, keep me sane, and give me a way to tune everyone out, a camera to capture every single moment, and a self-addressed envelopeâso there's no confusion as to where to send the million dollar check to.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
Todd. I'll be a smart player, shrewd, and pulling all the strings, a snake (but unbeknownst to others), and run circles around anyone in a final tribal speech. Also, Sophie. Not afraid to get stuff done, stand up for myself, and tell the boys what to do. I'll be the smartest player there.<br/>

<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
The title of Sole Survivor and the challenge.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I'm a triple threat to win this gameâI'm a former college athlete, an Ivy League graduate, and I know the game better than anyone else out there. I'm a superfan who knows better than to let the game pass me by and I will always fight for every single inch.

<br/>
<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong><br/>
Ironman. I'm most proud of not just the finish line at the event but the dedication to the training as a working single mom that went behind it. It made me a better human and changed my kids and my life. My racing is always a family affair and I couldn't do it without my two little cheerleaders. Also, I've done a lot of solo traveling. I've been to 24 countries and six continents. Backpacking and trekking solo is a massive passion of mine and feeds my wanderlust soul. It is adventurous and crazy at times but it's shaped me more than anything else in life.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
Bob Scott. 87 years old. He is my angel. I met him the week of my divorce and two weeks after his wife passed away. I like to think his angel wife brought us together. He taught me to swim shortly after we met because he wanted me to be a ""happy and fit mom"" for my boys. He helped me learn to ride a triathlon bike. He introduced me to the world of triathlon, which changed my world. He competed alongside me at my first half Ironman and full Ironman and still competes to this day. Bob taught me the sport is about fun, fitness, and friends and that to do this for life and be just like him, I had to keep this mentality. We still train together each week as well as compete alongside each other.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
Lipstick! Because I even wear it when I do my Ironman races! Next would be ear plugs because I'm an insanely light sleeper and hate snorers, and a piece of Rose Quartz because it's my favorite stone and would remind me to follow my heart and trust my intuition.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
A combo of Parvati for her heart and inner strength, Tyson for his sarcasm, Ozzy for his love of adventure, Courtney for her sass, and Mama C for being a strong and fierce mom.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
The adventure. I've watched every single episode of <em>Survivor</em> since it began 18 years ago and the adventure of the show keeps me coming back for more and applying over and over and over! And the social game! I have wanted to play the social game since the first season. Ever since I taught English in Russia in college and was dropped into Siberia with a random mix of girls I have loved the social game of learning to get along with people in a group setting and finding out what makes people tick. That's why I love traveling solo too, because I like to meet and connect with other people from different beliefs and backgrounds.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Because every day for the past 10 years, I have looked at a sticker on my mirror: ""Outwit, Outlast, Outplay. <em>Survivor</em>."" I never once have stopped believing that this dream would come true. I can have all the strategy in the world and I will! But if I have learned anything from watching the show, participating in endurance events, raising children, working in a fast-paced finance position, studying in an ashram, being an entrepreneur, or all my other adventures is that nothing turns out like you expect. I am really good at adapting to circumstances, to people, and to unlikely situations. Plan A quickly becomes Plan C and it doesn't shake me up. I can endure pain both mental and physical with a smile on my face. Adaptation. A sense of humor. Dreaming big. That embodies who I am and why I will win!

<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong><br/>
Getting on <em>Survivor</em>. But really, I am most proud of getting into UCLA Law, one of the best law schools in the country. Additionally, making it through the first year of law school taught me a lot about drive and perseverance.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
I don't have a particular source of inspiration in life because I don't believe in emulating or worshipping anyone. I think that everyone has positive traits to draw from as well as less desirable aspects.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
First, a notebook and pen to organize my thoughts and strategy. Second, my retainers because I have had my braces off for over a decade but am still too scared to try not wearing them. What if my pearly whites started moving around? And finally, a bottle of rum because no self-respecting sailor would be caught on a remote island without rum.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
I am passionate, competitive, and neurotic like Spencer. Also, I have the same penchant as him for making people feel irrelevant and that is something I will have to be very careful not to do during the game.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
To take a shot at playing a game I have watched religiously and loved since I was 9. I'd also like to win the million so I can pay off my student loans and then buy a sailboat and sail around the world.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I like to lead people and take initiative. Plus, I like to roast people and what doesn't build tribe morale more on <em>Survivor</em> than a few laughs from roasting the other tribe? I can also cook a mean batch of rice.

I am a U.S. Presidential Scholar selected by President Obama's commission, and interned for his White House administration. In college, I was a walk-on sprinter for Harvard Track and Field and, as a senior, was elected team captain by my teammates, becoming the first Asian American captain in program history.<br/>

<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
My grandfather came from a rural village in Korea, survived the Korean War, put himself through the best college in the country, and eventually became a successful businessman. He came from nothing to overcome tremendous odds and so much adversity and always exemplified love for family along the way. He passed away a couple of years ago but remains an inspiration in everything I do.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
First, a photo of my family. They'll be a source of emotional strength no matter how tough it gets out there. Second would be an American flag because being a first-generation American is one of the greatest sources of pride and willpower for me. Finally, a journal and pen to take notes on the game as it develops and also to keep a diary during the adventure of a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
Yul Kwon. Our backgrounds are uncannily similar as Korean-American management consultants, and I plan to follow his example in being cool, calm, and collected throughout the game. Yul's <em>Survivor</em> journey contributed greatly to the positive representation of Asian-Americans on TV, and I hope to do the same.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
<em>Survivor</em> is an adventure like no other. Everything it presentsâthe wilderness, the challenges, the fellow castaways from all cross-sections of Americaâwill be a chance for me to break out of the bubble I've been a part of for most of my life and push myself physically, emotionally, and mentally like never before. I'll embrace the challenge and have fun along the way.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
There is no magic formula to winning <em>Survivor</em>. However, there are qualities that will help players get far. I believe I have most of themâI am team-oriented, athletic, outgoing, and tenacious. I will focus on being a helpful, likable asset to those around me, and on the down low strategically pave my path to the very end.

In fact, it angers me when people act lazy and try to manipulate everyone around them and ruin everything. Now, those pet peeves are going to be alive and well in the land of <em>Survivor</em>. Good thing I know how to dish it right back. I have been around people like that my whole life and I know how to deal with it. So yeah, my title of Most Dramatic, in the face of a bunch of liars will be, shall we say... interesting.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Ambitious, charismatic, and charming.<br/>

<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong><br/>
My greatest accomplishment was being on a 5th Avenue Versace billboard! It was by no means the end all and be all of where I want to be in life, but it was a major accomplishment. To me it was an accumulation of everything I've worked hard for finally getting justified. It was a huge symbol of perseverance and it was gratifying. I rely on my own self-motivation and have accomplished stuff that was difficult and took legit perseverance, but winning <em>Survivor</em> will top all that.<br/>

My ma is my hero. But it wasn't always so. Growing up, my mom and I didn't have the best relationship. She was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) at 27 and had me at 34. God bless her. A lot of side effects of MS don't just affect the body, but the brain as well, such as depression. So as a kid, I couldn't handle or understand what was going on. I look back at my childhood and most memories of my mom and I were difficult. She would have seizures during my baseball games, at my school where she tutored, and the side effects of all the medications made it difficult to have a normal relationship with her.<br/>
<br/>
When I was 12, my parents split and the next couple years were even tougher as her disease progressed. If it wasn't for my father telling me I needed to rise above the past and grow up, I would have continued to struggle. When I was told she had two months to live I decided to become a man at 17, and our past struggles brought us even closer. Through the years, our relationship grew, and our love and respect for each other brought our relationship to all-time highs. None of this would be possible if she hadn't beat the odds for almost 10 years now.<br/>
<br/>
I will always idolize her perseverance, her grit, and her faith in God. She is the greatest hero anyone can have and I live through her. She never quit or gave in when she was told she had two months to live, so why should I ever quit or give in when life ""gets hard?"" Want to talk about a survivor? That's my mom.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
First would be a good luck necklace my mom gave me when she almost died. I've been wearing it ever since and crazy good things have happened since. Also, lotion, so I could give awesome massages and bond with the hot girls on my tribe, and finally a second bottle of lotionâI plan to be on the island for a while, and maybe I'll get one if I play my cards right!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
From Season 33, I would be a mix of Ken and Michaela. I would provide food like Ken. But unlike Ken, my social game would be on point. I would have Michaela's fire, determination, and athletic ability. I would also be blunt like her, but would do a better job of building relationships. In previous seasons, I would have the social and ladies game like Joe. Joe is eye candy and smooth. I would try and form a coalition with someone like him. He would be my shield and then I would cut him later in the game. As far as Season 36, I won't know whether to play the game like a Florida pantherâstealthy and in the shadows, or like a lionâdominating its tribe. I may have to be both, depending on the dynamic of the game.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
The game itself, and to spread the awareness of MS. 2.3 million people worldwide have MS and there is no cure! For me, like life, I've been finding ways to survive for a long time. I want to apply all my experiences with different personalities, and put them to the ultimate test. I want to compete and I want to win. This is a competition of survival. I am a type-A personality and I cannot stand the thought of losing. I have tunnel vision when it comes to winning and there is nothing out there, competition wise, like <em>Survivor</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I will bring my <em>Survivor</em> mental toughness, my ability to adapt, my positivity to aid the weak, and my will to survive. I might not know how to do some things, but I will find a way to eat and get water. Whether that's through my creativity, my charm with women, or my ability to make one of the guys my bro. Some men will not like my alpha mentality, which strategically, I will hold back in the beginning as I read people, but I will find my way. They always say ""don't bite the hand that feeds you."" I grew up on an island so if I'm one of the few that can get his own catch and get his own water (which are the two essentials of living), no one will bite that hand. I will have ultimate power.

<br/>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Outgoing, adventurous, and free spirited.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong><br/>
Being everyone's favorite person. I truly enjoy meeting people from various walks of life, becoming very good friends with them, keeping them in my life, and smiling the entire way.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
Bob Marley. That man knew how to live life. He understood what living meant and inspired people to love the life you live and live the life you love. I smile just thinking about that beautiful human.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
A waterproof camera. Life is an adventure. I'm in love with memories. I really enjoy capturing every twist and turn this beautiful life has to offer. A Hawaiian sling. I am a waterman, so being in the water, hunting for food is where I feel the most at home. True peace for my soul. A big bowl of gummy candy. I am absolutely addicted to candy, especially gummies. I can catch the meat, but I can't catch the candy.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
Tyson. He knew how to play the game through laughter, creativity, and good times. A true free spirit.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I've been waiting my entire life for an opportunity to show the world the many skills I have to offer. I feel like this is my calling. Also, almost everyone I know literally asks me all the time, ""Seb, why are you NOT on <em>Survivor</em>?"" I just feel like it's my time to shine.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I am perfect for this game. I spend most of my life outside in the elements, a lot of which is involved with something physical. I'm great with people and can make friends very easily. I enjoy being challenged in such ways that may be life risking. I can figure out little kinks to situations that others may not even think about.

<strong>Pet peeves:</strong> My pet peeves are laziness or unmotivated people when they have the ability and or resources to be and do so much more, and when someone expects someone else to pull their weight. One that believes things are ""rights versus privileges."" Also, unorganized people or things, close-minded individuals and people who think you ""owe"" them something.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Spontaneous, courageous, and determined.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your personal claim to fame</strong>?<br/>
Retirement from the U.S. Army. I served over 21 years in the Army and I was an Army officer captain. I served in the transportation unit and in a psychological Operations Battalion as an executive officer and I was the only female officer in the organization, yet still chosen to be second in command. I have been to several countries, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey, Dubai, France, Bratislava, Slovakia, Italy, and Germany.<br/>
<br/>
I was put in the most unusual and extreme situations and conditions and survived better than most. I was in isolated conditions where life's bare necessities were limited. While deployed to Iraq in 2003-2004, I went months with only taking bottle water showers. The supply lines were compromised so often I was forced to make a decision to either wash with my daily bottled water or consume it. I jumped from several different Military aircrafts and did drown-proofing that consisted of water survival.<br/>
<br/>
While deployed to Afghanistan, I was put in situations that required me to influence the local ""elders"" (leaders) of our U.S. missions in their country while at the same time earning their trust. This posed a huge issue because one, I am a female (and their beliefs with females are VERY different than ours) and two, I was an American. However, I was able to gain the trust of the local people as well as many elders.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
My son. He has been braver than he believes, stronger than he seems, and smarter than he thinks. I have never met a more amazing person than him.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
First would be my guitar because I have one and played a little in college but it would be a chance for me to have music and learn at the same time. Next would be paper and pen to document my experience. My memory is not the best and I want to capture as much as possible to remind me of the once in a lifetime experience I had. Finally, an iPod to listen to music.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
Michaela Bradshaw because not only was she fit, outspoken, attractive, and witty, she also spoke her mind and was extremely good at challenges. And when she won, she wasn't afraid to celebrate. She expressed her emotions on her face which is very similar to me. My friends tell me even when my mouth is shut, they know what I am saying because my facial expression ""talks."" I'm not afraid to express my feelings and I put a lot out there. I want to give my best self and Michaela never gave up. It was clearly depicted in the episode where she lost her top. I'll do whatever it takes to win, with or without my top.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
To fulfill an exciting and different adventure that a small percent of people get to do. I want to be part of the small group that was chosen and is remembered. Not because everyone can, or everyone gets chosen or remembered. I will be the person everyone remembers because of my unique skills and plays I will bring.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I am strong, hardworking, loyal, determined, and able to figure out most things. I am very versatile and by my looks, most wouldn't expect it. I am like the snake that you don't know is there until bitten. I have a strong ability to win people over and get them to want to do what I want just by actively listening.

<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
Kelley Wentworth. She was strategic, strong, sneaky, and a fighter. She wasn't afraid to make big moves. She played her own game and didn't hide in anyone's shadow.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
It has always been one of my dreams to be on <em>Survivor</em>. I have been a fan of the show since Season 2 and I know I have what it takes to be the Sole Survivor. Additionally, I would love to see a new part of the world and a million dollars wouldn't be bad either.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Being resilient, strong, and fearless are nice traits that should translate well on the island. For example, at a younger age I was a competitive gymnast on the national level and sustained a career-ending injury. Doctors told me I would never compete again as a gymnast, nor play other sports. Fortunately, in high school, I went to state finals in volleyball and diving and then earned a D1 diving scholarship to the University of South Carolina. Go Gamecocks!

<br/>

<br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
A picture of my wife and kids to keep me tethered to reality, a football to throw on the beach, and bacon jerky because it's delicious and doesn't need to be refrigerated.<br/>

<br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
Parvati. I think I could use my charm to build relationships, and I think I have the competitive spirit and wit she had.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
It is the experience of a lifetime. You get to push yourself to your absolute limits and challenge yourself in a unique way.

<br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
Elisabeth Filarski-Hasselbeck. I began to look up to Elisabeth when I first saw her on Survivor when I was 9 years old. Even at a young age, I looked up to her not only because of her outer beauty, but her noticeably beautiful heart and work ethic. I continued to follow her in all aspects of life, from standing up for her beliefs to working with people who stand on her same side. I am a strong believer in my faith and when it comes to politics, let's just say I'm a true southern girl. She is a badass blonde, but shows that her faith and family come first. To be able to balance all of that like she does makes her a hero and a mentor to me.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
My Bible because my faith is everything, a baseball hat, and a huge bag of my family's smokehouse Turkey Jerky.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
I would play a combination of Jenna Morasca and Kim Spradlin, and a little bit of Natalie White. Jenna because of her strategy to flirt to the finish. She wasn't afraid of much and used her strengths like beauty, social and brains to get her to the top. Kim because of her ability to keep cool when necessary and her athletic ability was on point. Natalie, because she used her southern outgoing charm to win hearts and keep her social game strong.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>? </strong><br/>
To win a million dollars. And to prove that this southern small town blonde is more than just a pretty face. I love adventure. I love challenges and I love to overcome them. Winning could be my chance to show the bullies in high school that I'm not little 'ol Libby anymore. It's a chance to show off my skills and strengths and use them to their full potential. Being on <em>Survivor</em> has been a dream of mine. I feel like God's been putting me through challenges and experiences in life to prepare me for this.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Because I know that I can outlast and outplay! I work out a lot. I have endurance, I danced for 12 years. I have balance. I've completed tough mudders, marathons, and other races so I can get myself through challenges. My social game is strong. Making friends and alliances wouldn't be an issue for me. Though I now work with technology and digital media, I grew up camping, hunting, and fishing. I love the outdoors so I know I can use that experience and those skills to outlast those 39 days. I'm strong, smart, and pretty and I know how to use it.

<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
To WIN! I love <em>Survivor</em> and I have wanted to be on the show from the moment I saw it as a kid. I've seen every episode and always imagined what it would be like if I was one of the contestants. It wasn't until recently when I saw Jeff at a <em>Survivor</em> event that the opportunity seemed realistic. I got him to take a quick selfie and then told him I would be on the show, and of course I had to make it happen after that. It will be challenging, but that is the best part. It's going to make winning so much more rewarding.Â <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?Â </strong><br/>
I believe I will be the final Survivor because not only am I good at reading people, but I know how to get what I want. I know how to work people into doing things for me and that could help me make big moves in the game.Â

It's very hard to pick only one, but I would say Kim Spradlin. I operate a lot like Kim as we are logical, strategic, and calculating but I'd like to think I would bring more excitement to the game as that season was a bit predictable.Â 
</p>
<p>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I love to do over-the-top challenging things that are totally outside of my norm, especially if someone says or expects that I cannot do it. I don't want people to ever think that I am predictable or for them to categorize me in restrictive ways. I have accomplished many things in life that my friends and family will not and often cannot do and yet they live vicariously through me and my sharing experiences and thatÂ is priceless.Â 
</p>
<p>
My other motivation is that <em>Survivor</em> is my dream come true adventure that I know I can absolutely win. To have the opportunity to compete and then to become the Sole Survivor and win the money, is like actors who make a living ""acting,"" live glamorous lives and can then be rewarded Best Actress/Actor at the Oscars.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?Â </strong><br/>
I am analytical, logical, calculating, strategic, and can read people well even when they are not openly sharing. I am a young 57-year-old with great energy and people often guess my age to be 10-15 years younger than I am. I understand the game and have always been a risk taker. I am not afraid to make big moves. I am a strong competitor in all that I do. I got this.

Â <br/>

Jeremy Collins. My personality will not allow me to fly under the radar, but I think my honesty and humor can take me for as long as I make a strong partnership.Â

<p>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I've been a fan for so long. I want to have the adventure first hand. I want to become the Sole Survivor and win the money so I can care for my sick father at home.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I believe I have an uncanny ability to read people well and gain their trust. I am also not hindered by what others back home will think of me, so I hopefully won't be afraid to make big moves.

Â <br/>
<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong><br/>
Pro wrestling fans around the world know John Hennigan as The Mayor Of Slamtown, Johnny Nitro, John Morrison, Johnny Mundo, Johnny Impact, the Shaman of Sexy, The Wednesday Night Delight... I've had more epic ring names than most wrestlers have had championships and in addition to those, plenty of other nicknames that aren't so nice.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?Â </strong><br/>
Mike Holloway with shades of CochranâI plan to form alliances early and play a loyal game at first. Play strategically in challenges; dominate when necessary. If it seems strategically wise I'll dominate challenges, but I plan to have more tact than Mike when it comes to publicly putting my desire to win the game over the group's happiness because that kills trust within the group. The way Cochran was there for people as a ""therapist"" is similar to how Mike stood up to for Shirin, but Cochran seemed to have a more constant relationship with his group than Mike.

<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I want to win and I want the money. I'm planning on buying a Corvette the size of a Hummer, but as fast as a Corvette. With some of my winnings.<br/>
<strong>Â <br/>
Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?Â </strong><br/>
My daily life consists of physical training, building relationships, and positioning myself favorably in dozens of wrestling organizations worldwide. I currently consistently work for over 20 different wrestling promotions all over the world. Two years ago, I came to Triple A without speaking fluent Spanish and sat in a locker room full of prideful luchadores, some of whom had worked for that company for over 20 years. Less than one year later, I'm the first non-Mexican Triple Champion of Triple A because I positioned myself strategically within that organization, built a great relationship with the owner, and by kicking ass, like I kick ass in the ring my talent could not be overlooked. I am an English speaking Irish-American who grew up in Palos Verdes, and a multi-million dollar Mexican wrestling company decided that I am the best person to represent their brand. Everywhere I go the challenge is the same. I win because I understand how to play the game.Â

Â <br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
Binoculars to try ""birding."" I've never done it, despite writing part of my dissertation on birds. Sounds relaxing. A graphing calculator; a good shelter is grounded in good trigonometry. Also, it should be grounded in dirt. And a thesaurus to give pity names to my strategic game moves.Â <br/>
<strong>Â <br/>
Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
Stephen Fishbach. He talked about the game as a chaotic whirlpool of alliances, and his nerdy game analysis warms my heart. I don't do poetry, but I wouldn't object to being called a wizard.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
To win and prove I'm not just a diploma or a rÃ©sumÃ©, that I'm a formidable person, qualifications or no. I also want to make my mark on this game and help innovate the way <em>Survivor</em> is strategically played. I need the game, and the game needs me.Â <br/>

<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?Â </strong><br/>
I'll win with my intelligence, kindness, and creativity. I'll be quick to assess threats and avenues of advancement while cultivating positive relationships with everyone. If I'm in a tight spot, I'll adapt and figure a way out. What could go wrong?

My mom always dropped wisdom. She was the epitome of what a mother should be to her kids. She was the perfect role model and practiced what she preached.

She'll always be my hero.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why?Â </strong><br/>
The book<em> The Untethered Soul</em> by Michael Singerâit talks a lot about clearing your mind and that could be crucial. A mirror. Sounds vein, but could help make a fire plus it would be interesting to see who insists on looking in it. A deck of cards; can be used for entertainment as well as another form of character judgement.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
Parvati Shallow because she's brilliant, she's flirtatious, and she won! Her alliances were well thought out and she made power plays at the right time. I would have a positive attitude and make connections like Figgy except I'd avoid getting into a showmance at all cost.Â 
</p>
<p>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
To win one million dollars! It would be nice to help my dad get back on his feet for good; he ran a successful business until he lost it all in the recession. I helped support, but I could only do so much. I also want to step outside my comfort zone to prove I can do anything with the right mindset. This would really help carry out my mom's legacy and make her really proud. I would also love to have a down payment for a house. I live in San Diego, one of the hottest real estate markets... and it's expensive!Â <br/>

<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?Â </strong><br/>
I am relentless. I don't give up. I know how to get along and even make friends with all walks of life. I'm kind of a chameleon. I guess I'd consider myself pretty savvy and adept. I observe everything, yet have the ability to keep to myself if need be. I'm strong and focused, therefore could be a threat in challenges. Plus, I am not afraid to be cutthroat if I have to. In today's world, I think you'd call that savage. My social game would be impressive, plus I could win over the jury with game tactics and strategy.Â

A copy of Maya Angelou's ""Still I Rise,""Â a poem that sums up my mindset for life and <em>Survivor</em>. A radio so I could listen to the news every day.

Natalie Anderson for her intellect, sense of timing and character. Parvati for her charm, social awareness and cunningness. And both women for their warrior spirits and overall badassness.Â 
</p>
<p>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Survivor is the ultimate challenge of grit, savviness, and strategy. As a naturally competitive person, I want to test myself, my abilities and my limits. As a military spouse, I believe we are most of the strongest and most adaptable people.Â 
</p>
<p>
I want to win because my husband will head out on his second deployment this year, and I want to be a source of strength and inspiration for other military families who have endured long months and years away from their soldier. Also, winning a million dollars is obviously a huge motivation--like many Americans I have a lot of student debt from school, and being able to pay that off would be a game changer.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?Â </strong><br/>
I have always been an extremely optimistic and positive person, I always see the best in everything/everyone and make the most out of even the hardest situations. Even though I'm not super outdoorsy, I'm a quick learner and always down to try something new.
</p>
<p>
I'm also scrappy, adaptable, smart, fun, and determined as hell. Most importantly though, my love for people, empathy, and emotional awareness are what I credit for much of what I've accomplished in my 28 years of life. I'm able to get along with anyone, and people tend to trust me.Â 
</p>
<p>
Lastly, I'm not afraid to take risks and play hard. I will use all of these skills, at the right time with the right people, in order to make it all the way to the end.

<strong>Â <br/>
Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
My brother Josh. He is in the U.S. military. Everything he does is out of love and pride for our country and the people in it. He loves and adores his family and is fiercely loyal to his faith and God. We were best friends growing up and we talked about everything. As we each have our own families now, we don't talk as much, but I love him more than ever. And I literally think of him anytime I am going through a struggle and I remember to keep pushing and don't quit!Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
My hat. I feel naked without my hat. Like I would wear my genuine wool lined raccoon hat to church when I was 11. My mom would sometimes try to get me to take it off, but it ended in a blow up fight. I wore my hat during labor and delivery for my two daughters, and also during my surgical C section with my son. I sure had to convince the surgeon to allow my hat in that operating room.Â 
</p>
<p>
And chocolate. Every girl who has ever had a period needs chocolate. It's also good for sad, or happy, or mad, or hungry.Â 
</p>
<p>
Finally, a notebook and a pencil. So I could keep track of my thoughts and plans better. Especially without someone to bounce ideas off ofâI would not want to forget something obvious.Â

<p>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
Big Tom from <em>Africa</em>. He was a redneck, funny, knows more about farming than current culture. Also, Sandra Diaz-Twine, who was passionate, smart, played the game hard, and objective.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Being true to who I am and pursuing my dreams. No matter how crazy. It's not crazy if it's something you want to do. I can't stand the idea of living with regrets. I want to LIVE my life. The craziest/stupidest thing someone could do would be to love cautiously and in fear. Pursue your dream, who knows it may come true.Â 
</p>
<p>
I can win! Like I believe I will win, if I get to hear Jeff say the words, ""Welcome to <em>Survivor</em>, here are your buffs."" I watched my first episode during <em>Australia</em> and loved it. Even as a kid, I knew I was made for this show. And that I could win and make all of us southerners proud!Â 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?Â </strong><br/>
I will be liked and needed by all especially at the beginning, the provider role. I will develop relationships with unlikely people and help bring cultures and ages together. I will be competitive in challenges. I am strong and don't quit. I didn't quit through my season of depression. Just kept putting one foot in front of the other. Didn't rely on feelings, but logic. I defend people and injustices. People talk to me because I am trustworthy. I have watched enough of the game to know how it is played, but not so fanatic about it that I am a geek. I just LOVE the show. I love strategy and don't mind cutting ties if it benefits me, even if it is hard. I have moved all over the planet and it all worked out.Â

<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Excitable, intelligent, and empathetic.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong><br/>
Going from a couch potato to an adventure-seeker who sometimes gets off the couch to hike mountains, including 14ers (mountains over 14,000 feet)!Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
Anyone brave enough to: be vulnerable, love with their whole heart, or speak out against injustice. Any anyone brave enough to rock bangs.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why?Â Â </strong><br/>
A phone to call my family and friends for love and advice. A journal so I could record my thoughts and plot out strategy. A mirror because I'd be scared something would be in my teeth the entire time and no one would tell me.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?Â Â </strong><br/>
I relate to Aubry because she is both smart and emotionally intelligent. I am prone to tear-filled moments like Dawn. And I'm flirty like Parvati... if she were bad at flirting and only nerdy guys liked her.Â 
</p>
<p>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Human psychology and social dynamics fascinate me, and I'm excited to insert myself into the craziest experiment out there. I simultaneously love and hate pushing myself out of my comfort zone. I want to see if I can rise above the mental, emotional, and physical turmoil found in this game.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?Â </strong><br/>
I have the knowledge of the game, but I'm social enough to hide it and not be a (complete) dork. I'm an emotional, empathetic person who happens to have the capacity for analytical thinking. My balance between brain and heart will win me allies and a million dollars.

<strong>Pet peeves: </strong>Not saying ""bless you"" when someone sneezes, people who chew with their mouth open, and people who interrupt while others are talking.<br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Outgoing, positive, and motivated.<br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong><br/>
When I was selected to be part of this game at such a young age. Some people have waited years to have this opportunity and I'm blessed to be able to participate in something that is so meaningful to me, as well as millions of others around the country.Â Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
Stephenie LaGrossa. Growing up I always admired her for her performance in her season. During <em>Guatemala</em>, she showed such determination, drive, and positivity. My goal in life is to stay positive no matter the situation. I believe life is all about how we react to situations, not the situation itself. My goal is to always take a step back, and evaluate what should come next.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why?Â Â </strong><br/>
My toothbrush because thinking about going 39 days without clean teeth makes me cringe. My pillow so I can have some sense of comfort. My Bible because my relationship with the Lord is extremely important to me, so having that there with me during this experience would mean a lot.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong>Â <br/>
My goal as I go in is to play most like Sarah did in <em>Game Changers</em>.Â She had a phenomenal social game and I feel as if I can do the same thing because of the relationships I normally build with people. While doing that I can still balance camp life, and hopefully make it as far as she did.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
My reason for being on the show is mainly the experience itself. I've grown up watching and loving <em>Survivor</em>. Never in a million years would I think I'd be participating in such an amazing life experiment. I am determined to push myself and see how strong I can be. I'm also excited to win a million dollars, that would be so life changing for myself and my family.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?Â </strong><br/>
I'll survive because I feel I'm extremely adaptable. I'm able to think fast, and make decisions when needed. I also have a lot of knowledge about the game itself and I don't think people will expect that. I thrive when I'm being underestimated and I feel like in this game ""the young blonde"" is easily looked over.Â

Â <br/>
<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong><br/>
Got fifth place in my grade school spelling bee.<br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
My parents taught me about work ethic, industry, and perseverance. They made so many sacrifices so that my siblings and I would have every opportunity possible. They pushed me to be the best version of myself. They also demonstrated daily how to lead a purposeful life guided by integrity and morality.Â 
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why?Â </strong><br/>
To quote Dwight K. Schrute, ""Physician's desk reference. Hollowed out. Inside, waterproof matches, iodine tablets, beet seeds, protein bars and a NASA blanket."" The reason seems obvious here. Also, face wash. I appreciate a good skincare regimen. And a Costco pack of Orbitz bubblemint gum for that minty fresh taste.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
Andrea Boehlke, a fellow Midwesterner, who is tough in challenges, hardworking around camp, strategic, and a fierce competitor.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I want to win a million dollars so that I may thank my parents for the endless opportunities that they have given me through the years. I also feel like I have lived an extraordinary life, but I am looking for new, unparalleled adventure. I have been on this well-defined path for ten years, pursuing medicine, and now is the perfect opportunity for me to deviate from the expected and do something totally unpredictable.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong>Â <br/>
The stakes are higher for me than most as I am acutely aware of what I am giving up (in stepping away from my patients and my program for two months), so I will not be afraid to make big moves. I will fight until the very end, and then when sitting across from the jury at the final Tribal Council, they will all commend the brilliant, strategic game I played.Â

<strong>Age:</strong> 27<br/>
<strong>Hometown: </strong>Lake Butler, Florida<br/>
<strong>Current Residence: </strong>Gainesville, Florida<br/>
<strong>Occupation:Â </strong>S.W.A.T. Officer
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hobbies: </strong>Working out in the gym, running at the stadium, or running the S.W.A.T. obstacle course, playing video games, and having date nights with my daughters.Â 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Pet peeves:</strong> I can't stand people that are lazy. Go out and get what you want! Don't complain about it and do nothing and expect it to happen. I also hate when people cut me off while I'm talking. Please let me finish what I have to say, it may be important.Â 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Determined, athletic, and competitive.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong><br/>
I am extremely proud of making our S.W.A.T. team. I had to work extremely hard to lose a ton of weight to be physically able to even try out, much less do well enough to make the team. I was one of the youngest and least experienced people to ever make our S.W.A.T. team.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
My hero is my stepfather, Tim. Tim met my mother shortly after my parents separated. My whole life he has always been a steady father figure and an amazing role model. He taught me the value of hard work and how to be a humble man. When I met Tim at seven years old, he had nothing. My mother and him worked diligently and started a company from nothing and now want for nothing.Â 
</p>
<p>
Don't get me wrong, they aren't billionaires, but they pretty much do what they want when they want. Tim works many long hours and long nights to provide an amazing life to our family. The best part about him is you will never hear him brag about it.Â 
</p>
<p>
There is a song written by Brad Paisley that makes me think of him and brings tears to my eyes when I hear it. It's called ""He Didn't Have to Be."" It talks about how his stepfather was a great father to him and he hoped that he can be half the dad that he didn't have to be. That describes how I feel about Tim.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why?</strong>Â  Â Â <br/>
A picture of my kids because I will miss them terribly. A Kindle with lots of books for entertainment. A hammock so I can have somewhere comfortable to sleep.Â 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?Â </strong><br/>
I feel like I can relate to Malcolm from Season 25 the most. I feel like I'm young and athletic like he is and that I could do well in the challenges, making me an asset to my team in the beginning. I also feel like I can play the game strategically like he did, helping me run deep in the game.Â 
</p>
<p>
I work in a profession that requires me to be able to talk to any type of person through all walks of life and be able to relate and convince them to do things that I may need them to do. Malcolm was such a likeable person that he was voted off because three other contestants knew they wouldn't beat him in the final vote. I feel like I'm a very likeable person. I am able to make friends and relate to people anywhere I go.Â 
</p>
<p>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
My primary motivation for being on the show is to win. A million dollars would be a great way for me to provide a great life for my children that I wouldn't be able to do otherwise. My secondary motivation is my desire to compete. I love competing and I love winning. I haven't been able to compete at a high level since I played college football and I would love to be able to compete against other gifted men and women.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?Â </strong><br/>
I believe that I could be the winner for multiple reasons. I have a strong desire to win. I always want to win at absolutely everything I do. Whether it be checkers with my girls or just trying to be the first one to a call for service at work. I always want to be first.Â 
</p>
<p>
I have a strong work ethic. When I put my mind on something and decide that's what I want, I go and get it. Prime examples would be making our S.W.A.T. team. Prior to trying out, I was a very overweight guy. I decided that I wanted to be more than just a regularly everyday beat cop and I did whatever it took to do it. I changed my diet drastically, I worked out every single day, and I went to the track and ran sprints 2-3 times a week.Â 
</p>
<p>
Lastly, I'm very good with people. My career requires me to be able to talk to people all day. Everything I do at work requires interaction with people, and more importantly people who are typically either angry or distressed. I am very good at talking to people and convincing them to do things that they typically wouldn't want to do. I am quite skilled at calming people down when they are upset or angry.Â

<strong>Occupation: </strong>Social Media Manager
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hobbies:</strong> Swimming, hiking, biking, fishingâbasically any outdoor activity that involves my huskies. Playing Scrabble, cosplaying, and memes!<br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Pet peeves:</strong> I don't like people making decisions for me, especially without asking my opinion. Never expect a free ride with me if I see you being complacent. I will push you to get up and show initiative. There's nothing that bothers me more than a lazy person who acts privileged around those who've had to work for things their entire life. Oh, and calling me Dave or David instead of <em>Davie</em>, my momma named me that!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Three words to describe you: </strong>Uncommon, adventurous, and calculating.<br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong><br/>
My online presence. I've always prided myself on my social media presence via various platforms. I wear my pages on my sleeve so to say that anything a person wants to know about me they can find on my multiple accounts. I've been proclaimed ""the social media guru"" among my closest friends because I know every trick and trinket to the game.Â 
</p>
<p>
Examples: Posting at peak hours to maximize the amount of ""likes"" you receive, guaranteed responses from females via Direct Messages (how to slide into them DMs), not to mention providing Grade A entertainment via video stories regularly.Â 
</p>
<p>
I've often also been told that my Instagram/Twitter/Facebook is ""my favorite"" from friends and even been called by my Instagram handle in public quite frequently (@iHateDavie) by strangers. Social media is also the reason I became employed with the top agency in the world for Public Health. I can say with confidence that it is my expertise and claim to fame undeniably.<br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
Rick Grimes is my hero, though he is a fictional character. I have learned so much from him, from leadership skills to dealing with new people and new surroundings. The lead character in <em>The Walking Dead</em>, Rick leads a group of average individuals who become stronger because of his teachings and experiences.Â Â 
</p>
<p>
He defeats all of his enemies in a strategic and calculating way. Rick is dedicated to the title that his group has given him and is a provider for his family and friends, like myself. He has good days and bad days but never gives up. I channel Rick in a crisis and it helps me stable my mind, while having a little fun in the process.<br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why?Â </strong> Â <br/>
My harmonica. I believe in therapy and relaxation and making my own music will do just that. When I am stressed in the game, I can create this escape mentally and physically and maybe even look for idols in the process or entertain a few people and make friends along the way.<br/>
<br/>
My Davy Crockett hat. It's my lucky hat. I have worn it to tests and passed and I have worn it on dates and gotten lucky. When I wear this hat, I channel my best self.
</p>
<p>
My Bible. I believe that Christ strengthens my being and it's important that I review his teachings, especially in times of chaos and struggle.Â Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?Â </strong><br/>
Jeremy Collins. He was genuinely a good guy that knew when to speak and knew when to observe, that's my Obama! Also, Tony Vlachos, in that he was an innovative thinker to the game. Finally, Adam Klein in that he's a family man with a giddy sense of humor. They are all winners and so am I!
</p>
<p>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I want to prove to myself that I can do this. I was always teased for not playing popular sports like my friends so this would be my ultimate competition. I'm the middle child so almost the black sheep of the family. Both of my brothers are so accomplished so I want to have my own unique medal of self-accomplishment. My secondary motivation is my pack, my huskies. Recently, my beta wolf Luna Moon was hit by a car. I thought she was dead but we were able to save her. However, not without me being in debt. With my winnings, I want to create an insurance company for pet owners so that when things like this happen to us, we won't be faced with the hardest decision of our lives (putting a pet down).Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I understand how packs work. As a Siberian husky breeder, I know that in order to gain the trust of my pups, I have to feed them. I'm a skilled fisherman so as soon as I can get in the water to catch fish for my tribe, I will earn their trust. I also build doghouses and construct kennels for my pups and with my tribe, this would be no different. Creating new innovative, comforting types of shelter will show me as an asset. Lastly, with my pack, I have to be stern with them. I will mingle with the entire tribe, not just a few to show my sociability while also being assertive with them when it's time to put my foot down.

<strong>What's your personal claim to fame?</strong><br/>
Going back to school and making it to grad school.Â <br/>

<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
My hero is my mom, but please don't tell her! She went back to college after 40 years, completed her undergrad with a dual concentration and graduated Cum Laude way before I did. I saw her overcoming her fears and school struggles. She never gave up and we even took classes together!Â 
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why?Â </strong><br/>
My sketch book with a pencil for drawing and writing. The book <em>100 Years of Solitude </em>because it's one of my favorites. My kickboxing gloves to practice.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Which Survivor contestant are you most like?Â </strong><br/>
Probably Sandra. Her first two seasons with the ""as long as it's not me' and playing low key until the end was good. I would also have eaten that goat if possible on <em>Game Changers</em>. It's food!Â 
</p>
<p>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I want to prove to myself and my friends that I can do this. I've been a fan of the show since the first season, although sometimes I forget some details. My friends think that just because I don't go camping, I can't do it. This is also a social game, not just physical, and I think I can outwit and outlast just being me and using my brains. I also have student loans and a Ph.D to pay. I would also like to win the game for parents and friends. After Hurricane Maria, things got very hectic back home in Puerto Rico, and I would love to be able to help them.<br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I might not be a physical threat, although I have been doing kickboxing for about four months, but I think studying other contestants, using their weaknesses to my advantage and keeping a good social game, I would win. I am mostly relying on my social game. I will vote off people but my relationships with them would be real. I am a very loyal, honest person, so I would try not to backstab people, but it's a game and I want to win.Â

Becoming a Redneck Lawyer! I am a first generation college student and the first in my family to get a bachelor degree. I am also proud of myself for being a public defender to help people instead of chasing moneyâespeciallyÂ because money and the thought of being rich motivated me in school.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
Mamaw Joanâmy grandma. She is the most selfless person I've ever met. When my mom and dad got divorced she raised me and my four siblings while we stayed with my dad. She taught me life-changing lessons like the value of hard work and the importance of helping others. She also taught me how to enjoy a beer and some bluegrass music. Work hard, play hard, love hard. Her favorite quote was, ""If you don't use it, you lose it!""Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?</strong><br/>
A cooler, beer, and a radio. Nothing beats being outdoors and putting a few back. As great as it is at a tailgate, on the lake, or at a bonfire, I bet it would be even more enjoyable on the beaches of Fiji.Â 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong>Â <br/>
J.T. from <em>Tocantins</em>, <em>Heroes vs. Villains</em>, and <em>Game Changers</em>. I've got that Southern charm. I can be hard headed when in the heat of a competition. I'll either win or get myself sent home with a massive swing for the fences. No regrets!Â 
</p>
<p>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I think there are three reasons people play <em>Survivor</em>: adventure, money, and fame. My primary motivation is the experience and adventure! It has been my dream to play this game since I was a little kid. I want to push myself even further in life then I already have and test myself.Â 
</p>
<p>
My secondary motivation is the money. If I had a million dollars, I could pay off my student loans, which would open up my career options a little more. Money is not my primary motivation, because I anticipate I will make a million dollars in my career at some point.Â 
</p>
<p>
I do not care about fame. These days, <em>Survivor</em> contestants are only famous for about six months, anyways.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?Â </strong><br/>
I know I could be the final Survivor because I am the total package for this game, First, I am an adamant, hard-working son of a gun. I have chased my dreams my whole life and achieved those, despite humble beginnings.
</p>
<p>
Second, I am a likeable, social guy. Third, I am physically fit and stronger than I look. I will do great in the challengesâtribal and individual, physical and puzzle. Fourth, I am very smart and it is hidden well behind my accent and appreciation for small town life. I will definitely be underestimated.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I am a <em>Survivor</em> strategy expert. I am a super fan who has analyzed every season and every move. As I said, I am the <em>Survivor</em> total package.Â Â

<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?Â  Â </strong><br/>
Hopefully, I've gained enough experience from my last two failed attempts and I can take all that I learned and apply it. I know I can get to the end if I'm adaptable enough. I just have to constantly adjust and rely on both my past knowledge of how to interact and motivate others to produce good, positive results. Just going to play ""smarter, not harder.""Â </div>"

Â <br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?Â </strong><br/>
This is going to sound nuts, but my guinea pig Scamp. She's been sick from the moment I got her. She's had two surgery stints, countless vet visits, and tons of medications, but she's still the happiest, feistiest, and most amazing little fur-ball. She has such a distinct personality and loves eating so much. I just respect that about her and strive to be that simplistically happy.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?Â </strong><br/>
A notebook and pencil (this is one item) to keep track of all my thoughts and to sketch.Â <br/>
Baby pillow: this tiny pillow I've had since I was born that I sleep with every night.Â <br/>
A guitar: No clue how to play one, but I figure I'll have lots of time to learn.Â Â <br/>

<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you the most like?Â Â </strong><br/>
I relate to Malcolm Freberg. If you read his Wiki Fandom page, he's described as ""likable, strategic, and excels at challenges"" and I'd like to think I am the same way.Â <br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?Â Â </strong><br/>
My primary motivation is the once in a lifetime adventure! I've been watching since I was a little kid, and it's always been something I've wanted to do. Every contestant says its life-changing. Secondary: the shot at a million dollars, of course!Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?Â Â </strong><br/>
Â I truly think I have everything it takes to outwit, outplay, and outlast. I am and always have been a hustler. I work hard to achieve my goals. I'm sociable, very smart, strong, and self-aware enough to know when to tone down the quantities that make me a threat. I'm not afraid to lie and backstab, but I'm smart enough to know without alliances and bonds, you will never win.Â </div>"

Primary: I love <em>Survivor</em>, and I don't want <em>Game Changers</em> to be the end of my story. Season 34 was rough from the moment Queen Sandra said, ""thank you, next"" to my olive branch offer. Above all, I'm addicted to challenging myself, evolving, and saying ""yes"" to the experience.

Jeremy! He was a physical beast, but he was strategic in his use of Idols, loyal to his alliance, and overall honest and personable in his gameplay. He was a well-rounded player.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?Â Â </strong><br/>
It has been my dream to be on <em>Survivor</em> since I started watching as a kid. It started after the passing of my father, and in a sense, it helped me ""survive"" my own challenges. I want to prove to myself I can do this. To win a million dollars is also a huge motivation. I have many student loans and I want to be able to help my sister and mother.<br/>

<strong>Occupation:</strong> Teacher, Ron Clark Academy<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Hobbies:</strong> Life doesn't get any better than giving my Chow Chow pups belly rubs! I also get a kick out of watching the roulette ball spin and land in the single zero, but I think my main hobby is surprising people by making really unique moments for them. When I was a kid my family didn't have money, but my parents put a lot of effort into making simple moments magical. I now try to follow in their footsteps and try my best to do that for my students, friends, and family. I also like telling stories and participating in anything competitive such as poker, pool, trivia, basketball, tennis and ""Bamboo Stick Speller,"" a game my friends and I created.Â <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Pet peeves:</strong> I'm a sore loser. Like really sore. I'll stew over a Monopoly loss for weeks, wondering, ""just where did I go wrong."" Also, I hate when people slurp food (like soup) or smack chew gum. People, we can hear you!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Visionary, compassionate, ""mean girl.""<br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>What is your personal claim to fame?Â Â </strong><br/>
I co-founded the Ron Clark Academy in Atlanta where we teach using passion, innovative strategies, and creative methods to inspire all of our students to reach success. Each week, we also train educators from around the world so that they can incorporate our strategies in their schools. To date, over 50,000 educators have visited RCA to receive training, and we are starting a revolution! I hope that doesn't overshadow the fact that back in 2002 I won the Showcase Showdown on <em>The Price is Right</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?Â </strong><br/>
My students inspire me to do more and be a better person! I love the way they forgive easily, laugh heartily and bounce back. They are great role models! Also: Antoni GaudÃ­ gives me life! He is the most creative genius to ever walk the earth!!<br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?Â </strong><br/>
A recording device that I could leave under the shelter so that I would always be in the know.<br/>

My wedding ring so I'd be inspired by the love waiting for me at home.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you the most like?Â Â </strong><br/>
I'm a compassionate person, but everyone who knows me well says that during competitions I turn into a villain. I also over analyze everything. For those reasons, I don't think there's a past contestant that is a perfect fit for me, but I think my gameplay will be most like Spencer Bledsoe.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?Â Â </strong><br/>
Since <em>Survivor: Borneo </em>I have been hooked. My friends and I have hung on every episode, pausing constantly to debate moves and re-watching our favorite episodes again and again. I tell my students all the time that life is for living and that they should seek to never have regrets. ""Dream Big!""After watching <em>Survivor</em> for most of my adult life, I finally decided to take my own advice and apply. I want to live the experience and share my journey with the ones I love. It would be a monumental moment in my life!Â <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?Â Â </strong><br/>
My passion for life rubs off on people, and with focus, I can change people's moods and get them to follow my lead. I'll use my southern charm to disarm, my big personality to entertain and my loyal nature to disorient.Â </div>"

The Wardog is his own blendâIâm not Tony, I'm not the Specialist, I'm not Boston Rob. Whose game did I respect the most? That's a better question. I thought Yul played great, I thought Mike was a great winner, I loved Parvati's game, Earl dominated, the third version of Tyson, the first version of Country Bumpkin (J.T).<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?Â Â </strong><br/>
Win the game of games! Also, to go on an adventure that few will ever partake in, and to challenge myself physically, mentally, and emotionally.<br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?Â Â </strong><br/>
I bring a certain sex appeal that men my age haven't had for over a decade or most have never had. But I digress; I also bring a sharp mind, likable joyful personality, one that can be both subservient when I need to be and a leader when there is a vacuum of leadership. I bring a strong set of physical skills, and I won't be the one whining and complaining. In the end, I'll make them laugh when we are all having a miserable moment.</div>"

Â <br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?Â </strong><br/>
I would definitely need to take a small jar of Vaseline, my lips get dry!<br/>
Hair ties: I cannot stand when my hair is in my face! I need it up to win challenges.<br/>
Last but not least, I really want to take Scruffy. Okay context time: I have a stuffed animal that I have had for 20 years and I have never slept without him even to this day. My sister and BF insist I don't take him because what if I get him sandy or ruin him. I'm conflicted.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you the most like?Â Â </strong><br/>

<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?Â </strong><br/>
I would like to be on the show because I want to see how tough it really is. I love putting myself in these kinds of situations and when watching the show, I have a sense that I can do this with ease.Â <br/>
<br/>
My second motivation would probably be the money. Not in the typical sense. I have always said that I want to be rich just so I am able to help other people.

<br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you the most like?Â Â </strong><br/>
I have to say Tony Vlachos. I don't think we are very similar people but I think we agree fundamentally on how you play the game. Tony was a grinder from start to finish. He understands that EVERY piece of the game, EVERY moment, EVERY situation has value and can be used to influence your outcome. I think most players only identify the most obvious parts of <em>Survivor</em> as pieces on the board when in reality, every last detail is a movable piece. It's going to be my goal to be ""ON"" all the time in the game. In other words, to never stop playing. I plan to work angles everywhere and with everyone... all the time. I think this is how you win, by paying attention to the details and then playing off of them. Tony did that I think, and so will I.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?Â Â </strong><br/>
My primary goal of being on the show is for the adventure of it! Adventure is something that is important to me, and something I think I will always pursue. But this adventure is a unique opportunity to practice the things I preach to my sons. The show will give me an opportunity to show them that hard work pays off and that pipe dreams are absolutely worth chasing! This show is a special platform to tell a really good story!Â Â <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?Â Â </strong><br/>
I think I have a lot of skills that serve a team well. I have a strong work ethic, I'm good with my hands, I'm strong and physical, and I think I'm good at making people feel valued. Another thing I am good at is keeping/bringing people together. I think I have the gift of mediation, which will be HUGE in <em>Survivor</em>! Someone has to keep the alliance glue sticky... I just might be that guy.</div>"

I love the show and have been obsessed with it since the beginning. I want to be in the depths of the conversations, manipulations, and absolute psychological warfare.

<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
My parents inspire me. They love passionately: each other, their family, and their friends. They model compassion and selflessness through their daily actions and have taught me to persevere through grief and smile through life's toughest obstacles. They've inspired me to fight for things I believe in and they always remind me that my value is not determined by the perception of others. They love abundantly and without reservation, cheer for others in every circumstance, and model how to reflect Jesus in my life.Â <br/>

M&amp;Ms.<br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you the most like?Â Â </strong><br/>
Parvati Shallow is my spirit animal. Her infectious smile, smart wit, and expertise in using her sexuality has won her a place in my heart and I feel like my gameplay could be similar to hers. I also strongly relate to Kelley Wentworth's gameplay. She is unapologetically herself, dominates the physical demands of <em>Survivor</em>, and is a threat in any type of challenge. Ideally, I would play the game as a perfect mix of these two powerful females.<br/>

My primary motivation for being on the show is to test my INDIVIDUAL capacity to rise to all the challenges I will face. I have played team sports from the time I was four years old and so have always had teammates to rely on when competition was intense. This game will push me to rely on MYSELF, with no parents or teammates who have my back, nobody to lift me up emotionally, and nobody to help me through the physical demands. It will be a true test of MY strengths, my confidence in my social skills, and my individual ability to build alliances that will benefit me, all in a very short and intense time period. The fierce competition from the starting moment is what draws me to this game. This has always been a dream and goal of mine! I told my family when I was seven years old that I would be on <em>Survivor</em>, and I FINALLY am!Â Â <br/>
<br/>
My final motivation is that I will be applying to dental school next year which is an extremely expensive dream, so when I am named Sole Survivor I'll be able to pay for this dream without incurring more debt. As a dentist, I plan to change lives by instilling confidence through beautiful smiles, and winning this game will help me to achieve this without the burden of debilitating debt.<br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?Â Â </strong><br/>
I have a competitive drive that few people can hope to match. I am a fierce athlete with the ability to endure extreme physical battles coupled with the desire to throw myself wholeheartedly into new adventures and challenging situations. ""Surviving"" won't be an issueâI plan to outlast and win. I am brilliantly strategic, but subtly humble about it, so people are not intimidated. In addition, I have a plan for a spectacular social game that cannot be beaten:Â  allowing people to feel like they are in charge, while ensuring them that they are important, loved, and valued, all while I am masterminding moves in the background. I've studied this game for years, my Barbie and Ken doll were named Tina and Colby, and I know exactly how to manipulate if necessary in order to win.</div>"

<br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?Â </strong><br/>
My husband. He is incredibly smart, caring, and selfless. He has always been there for me and supports me in everything I do. Every time I watch him with our children, it reminds me that he is the best example of what a parent should be and inspires me to be a better parent myself.<br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?Â </strong><br/>

<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you the most like?Â Â </strong><br/>
A combo of Stephanie for her tenacity, Cirie for her humor and fun-spirit, and Dawn for her propensity to have some emotional moments.Â Â <br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?Â Â </strong><br/>
The challenge. I have wanted to play this insane game since I saw the very first episode. Something about pushing myself to the absolute physical and mental limit possible has always appealed to me. It's about proving to myself and to those that know me that I can actually do this!.<br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?Â Â </strong><br/>
There is no doubt that I will be out of my comfort zone every step of the way, but when I set out to do something I become laser focused and I never give up. While I may not be the strongest physical player out there, I am smart, social, and will play the game with both my brain and my heart. I have waited 18 years to do this and nothing is going to stop me from winning. No other outcome is even an option!</div>"

<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Religious, competitive, and creative.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is your personal claim to fame?Â Â </strong><br/>
Getting the Jackie Robinson scholarship because I had never before achieved something on a national level. It still amazes me! They had over 3,500 applicants, gave interviews to 140 and awarded only 63. To be a part of that 63 still leaves me in awe and I know it's only by God's grace.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?Â </strong><br/>
My inspirations are definitely my mom and grandma! Without them there's no way I would be the type of person I am today. They taught me morals, values, and how to always have a loving and caring personality. They've seen me at my lowest times and have never withheld their love for me. We never had much but my mom always made ends meet for me. My grandma was the one who first started me on my walk in faith, which is my biggest rock in life. They are my heroes!<br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>If you could have three things on the island, what would they be and why?Â </strong><br/>
My Bible because it would be a constant reminder for me that God is always watching over me!Â <br/>
My poetry book because my poetry gives me life!Â <br/>
My Black Panther jacket because I'm a Marvel fanatic and it can always bring a smile to my face.Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you the most like?Â Â </strong><br/>
I relate to Jeremy Collins because that was a family man. He put his family above all else and played solely for them. My family is the only tangible thing I've always had since day one! They're my reason for everything. I also think I'd love to rely more on social gameplay as he did and connect with people for longevity.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?Â </strong><br/>
No doubt my primary motivation for being on the show is my family. Since I was born, we've lived in the same trailer without much change. Ever since I was doing well in school, I feel like eyes have been on me to help us out of stagnation. If I can make some things happen to help us go above and beyond, then you can best believe I'm going to be that breakthrough. <em>Survivor</em> may just be that start for me. Secondly, I'm motivated to learn more about myself. I've never had to find my food or stay outside, so I'm ready to see what I can do when tested. And of course, I'm a superfan and this has been a dream of mine! I'm already the youngest black castaway to date.Â  How cool would it be to add being the youngest Sole Survivor onto that?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?Â  Â </strong><br/>
I know I can be the Sole Survivor because I've already been living against the odds. Me being a lower-class black man, I wasn't nurtured to be the salutatorian of his class that would be able to afford Duke University of all places. I didn't have the bloodline of doctors to show me how to succeed or the finances to take prep classes for educational opportunities. I didn't even know what class rank or GPA meant until junior year. When I took the Pre-SAT, I asked ""What class is this for?"" I was set at a disadvantage, yet I made things happen. I went against the grain, and did what I needed to do to put myself on a pre-med track. I'm driven, focused, and possess the willpower to make mountains move. Nothing has stopped me thus far, so no 17 or 19, or however many castaways are going to stop me now!</div>"

<br/>
<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?Â Â </strong><br/>
My primary motivation is to say that I accomplished the goal that I was set out to doâwin!Â  Even if the grand prize was $1,000, if I say I am going to do something, then I am everything in my control to achieve it.Â Â <br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?Â Â </strong><br/>
I can make fire, fish, build shelter, and I will most likely be cooking a lot of meals (I'm big into cooking). Also, I'd work hard and won't lay around camp. I'm a team player in terms of getting a group to work together, I am extremely competitive, and I will do whatever it takes to help my team win!</div>"

<br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?Â </strong><br/>
My mom and dad. They have been my support system for the past 23 years and I wouldn't be the person I am today without them. They have taught me to always show kindness, no matter the situation.

<strong>What's your reason for being on <em>Survivor</em>?Â Â </strong><br/>
I have this internal drive to win the show. I listen to the theme song when I shower and I dream of winning Immunity. It's just a burning desire I have always had. I love this show. Also, to prove to my mom I won't be voted out first. She about died when I showed her the application.Â  She said I would embarrass myself or pass out when I got hungry. You just wait, Mom...<br/>

<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?Â Â </strong><br/>
First off, if I can survive running a summer camp with 100 crazy kids, I know I can survive on an island with 20 crazy people. That's 80 less crazies to deal with! I'm from the south, so being outdoors is in my blood. I also bring the mindset where if you want something, you get off your ass and go get it. Nothing will be handed to you. I will earn my spot in the group.Â  Â </div>"

That I am musically inclined.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
Jeremy Collins because he's charismatic, loyal, compassionate, and can read players so well. Strategically, my approach would be a hybrid of Devon Pintoâbluffing the dumb role sneakily wellâand Boston Robâimpeccable timing of making big moves and sniffing out when people are up to something.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your primary motivation for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
To challenge myself like I never have before. I spend my life adapting to ever-changing environments. I grew up in a rough inner-city neighborhood and rose above and have been successful in one of the most competitive, cutthroat businesses on Earth. Poker is such a great challenge and competition and I want to always challenge myself to do better and better. There is no greater challenge in life than <em>Survivor</em>, I must conquer it.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Because of the life I have already survived. It was a crazy rough neighborhood I grew up in, but I made it out and I have even traveled to 30 countries since then. I am also a beast at physical challenges. I have a very strong social game and, thanks to my poker skills, I will be able to read people well and will blindside the ""blindsiders."" I will be able to break hearts when I need to, even my own. The relationships will be real, but the ultimate goal will always be Sole Survivor.</div>"

<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
Parvati (who is the most obvious selection that everyone strives to be) because she was charming as she was being manipulative. She allowed herself to be grouped into a ""dumb girl alliance"" but controlled the social situation throughout. I also relate to Wendell. Like Wendell, I am able to remain emotionally neutral and find humor in stressful or irritating situations.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your primary motivation for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I have wanted to compete on <em>Survivor</em> since I first watched Elisabeth Filarski jump off that cliff in the Australian Outback. Now that it's happening (!!!), I keep reminding myself that the show is for money and not just an adventure. I want a behind-the-scenes look at the show I love, and I want to test my mind, body, and social prowess. The opportunity to graduate law school with zero debt is a bonus.<br/>

I am smart, strong, and not annoying. Discomfort and being dirty don't bother me. I can fit in anywhere and form relationships with anyone.

Self-awareness is one of the most important leadership characteristics. My social intelligence will allow me to read when to go big and when to fall back. I strongly believe in my ability to get along with and be liked by a variety of different people. This will allow me to build strong, diverse alliances. Additionally, my athletic and puzzle abilities will make me a threat within challenges. My experience working in sales will fuel my persuasion within my alliances.</div>"

<strong>What's your primary motivation for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
The love of the game. I love <em>Survivor</em> and I want to play this game. I need to play. This is like Darwinism in its truest form.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
<em>Survivor</em> is a relationship-based game. First, I will develop the relationships needed to win the game. I have a deep and fundamental understanding of human communication and connection. I have an uncanny ability to make strangers feel at ease. I disarm them with humor and self-deprecation. But I reinforce the connections with true and sincere interest and care. I will build relationships that will not only take me further into the game, but will win me the votes at final Tribal Council. Second, I will take control of my game and lead my allies to make favorable decisions to my game. I am a natural leader. Third, I will outwork my competition; I am an animal. I am resilient and hardworking. When I start something, I NEED to finish it.</div>"

<strong>What accomplishment are you most proud of?</strong><br/>
It might seem a bit trivial, but I am most proud of buying my mother a new and modern refrigerator for Mother's Day in 2017. She and my father were not able to afford new appliances and had been using the same old refrigerator for 12 years, so it was really meaningful for me to buy her something she really wanted and needed.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
Like so many children of refugees, I am here today because of my parents' sacrifices. My father's journey was especially harrowing. He, Txooj Zeb Muas, is my hero and quite literally, a true survivor. Faced with unknown odds, he risked everything to have a chance at living. At 16 years old, my father and his two cousins ran from the mountains of Laosâthrough jungles laced with landmines and buzzing with bullets from communist Viet Cong and Pathet Lao followersâto refugee camps in Thailand in an attempt to escape ethnic genocide of the Hmong and Mien people who were abandoned after being recruited for guerilla warfare. After miraculously making it across the Mekong River and into the camps, he was relocated to Montana with nothing more than the clothes on his back. Despite the struggles of being forced into a totally foreign country with no immediate family members, he has never given up on living life to its fullest potential. I have had the privilege of growing up without the fears of being exposed to Agent Orange, ethnic persecution, and displacement because of his resilience, his perseverance, his defiance, and his traumatic experiences.<br/>

<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
Vince is Vince. <em>Survivor</em> ain't never had anyone like me before, haha. IF I had to choose, I'd say a mix of Shii Ann Huang, because she didn't let nobody mess with her. The Shii Devil, Cirie Fields, because she's humble, analytical, strategic, and inspirational, and Natalie Anderson, because she was loyal, innovative, and an overall boss!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your primary motivation for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Honestly, I am here to show minority young folk and people across the world that they matter, that their stories and narratives are important, and that they should never doubt their existence regardless of what others say. <em>Survivor</em> has been an integral part of my life. It showed me that a kid from Merced could dream of traveling abroad, take big risks, and be more than another statistic. I hope that winning the title of ""Sole Survivor"" inspires other kids to challenge the oppressive systems and institutions that seek to keep them down!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I have accumulated grit from the challenges that I've faced throughout my life and have always been able to gain the trust and confidence of others. I believe I can use my unassuming image and 209 vernacular to fool others into believing that I am not an immediate threat. However, I'd say I'm pretty crafty and will be able to use my smarts to create plans and execute votes that will eliminate anyone I feel is a threat to my game (if you're not with me, you're dead to me). I also understand how to deal with big egos and personal quirks and can use my social skills to build confidence among all characters. Lastly, I've got quite a mouth and can smack the Jury with an award-winning final Tribal Council speech to guarantee my win.</div>"

<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I can navigate anyone and every social scenario. I understand I will be a target for people, and I do not take that lightly. I will get rid of anyone I view as a threat to me, without moral qualms. At the same time, I will be intentional in trying to remain more in the background and not viewed as a threat. Finally, if it came to life or death in a challenge, my smarts, physical ability, and focus will always make me a fierce competitor.</div>"

<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I feel like I was born to play this game. I've always craved challenges that help me learn more about myself, and I know deep down that I do have the physical, mental, and social skills to outlast, outwit, and outplay anyone. My job and my life experiences have trained me exactly how to win. I am hungry to be out in the wild, pushing myself to the edge, and doing things I never dreamed I could do. In the end, surviving this game means something more valuable than money to me.</div>"

<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
I would say if you combined David Wright's strategy, Davie's social game, and a pinch of Amanda Kimmel's likeability. These three players were fans of the game, played hard, and did everything they could do with the hands they were dealt.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your primary motivation for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I am on the show to do something most people dream about. I am there to win the game and get the million dollars. Those are my only motivations. If I happen to make people smile and help them escape whatever hardships are going on in their lives for an hour a week, that is a huge plus too.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I am physical and can win challenges, but that won't win <em>Survivor</em>. What wins <em>Survivor</em> is the time spent opening up and connecting to people. When you have real connections with people they will keep you around longer. Also, I am there to win the game. I see myself finding idols, making moves and leading blindsides.</div>"

<br/>
<strong>What accomplishment are you most proud of?</strong><br/>
My educational path is something I'm most proud of. After 8 years at P.S. 27, a Jersey City public school where my mom is still a teacher, I was accepted to the Prep for Prep program in New York. That experience prepared me for high school at Milton Academy, a New England prep school, which opened the door for me to attend and graduate from Brown University, an Ivy League school in Providence, R.I. With some bumps along the way and lots of help from those who care about me, I was able to make it through and be where I am today.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
Barack Obama. I wasn't all that politically aware prior to his run for president. He spoke to me. He inspired me to get involved and care about our world in a more engaged way. I've read his books, watched his speeches, and followed his presidency. The thoughtfulness, grace, optimism, and commitment he showed is absolutely uplifting. If we can approach life with his same attitude and aspire towards excellence the way he does, we'd all be better off.<br/>

Stepping up and taking care of my loved ones when they needed me. I took care of my grandpa who helped raise me when he got sick until he passed. My godmother lost her daughter and her husband, then had a stroke all within eight months. I was all she had to get through everything. My mom recently was in a coma and on life support. For months, she fought to get stronger and relearn everything. I was by her side the whole time. The plan was for her to come live with me afterwards so I could take care of her. Unfortunately, she passed away from complications before that could happen. To some, stuff like that may not be an accomplishment, but to me that's the only stuff that matters. I'm proud to be that kind of person.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
My godmother. She took me in when I was young, and treated me like her own ever since. She is the strongest woman I know. She is kind, caring and very loving, even though she has suffered a great deal over the past few years. She's awesome.<br/>

<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
I think I am most like Rupert, rough and raw on the outside, and a big marshmallow on the inside. He seemed to be a very kind person just like me.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I think people will underestimate me. I think with my people skills and my ability to relate to different types of people, I will be able to befriend them or gain their trust. I would be overlooked because I wouldn't be a threat, but an ally.</div>"

<strong>Pet peeves: </strong>The chunky dad sneakers trend that suddenly made a comeback and makes it look like you have bricks strapped to your feet.

<br/>
<strong>Three words to describe you: </strong>Driven, competitive, and scrappy.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What accomplishment are you most proud of?</strong><br/>
Getting on <em>Survivor</em>. I started applying to the show when I was 21, and I remember believing once I put in that application, <em>Survivor </em>would be chomping at the bit to invite me to play this game. Little did I know at that point that this would be the start to a very long journey. After almost six straight years of applying, with rejection after rejection after rejection, I finally contemplated throwing in the towel. Yet, as hard as I tried to push it away, I could never get the thoughts and urges to play out of my mind and out of my heart. I've never quit anything in my life, and I'm so proud of myself for never giving up on my dream, despite people telling me to do so. The best thing I ever did was believe in myself.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who or what is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
Larry David because he respects wood.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's one thing we wouldn't know from seeing a photo of you?</strong><br/>
I'm pretty, pretty, pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which <em>Survivor</em> contestant are you most like?</strong><br/>
Parvati and Kelley Wentworth, although I am aware the two girls play very different games. Parvati plays a very social, flirty, unsuspecting game, and establishes herself in power when she can. Kelley plays a very sneaky, threatening and aggressive game, tends to be more in your face with what she wants to accomplish, with a ""never give up"" type of attitude. I see myself in both of them.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's your primary motivation for being on <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
It's the allure of this really amazing game, this game I've been dreaming of playing since I was 8 years old. This game that will strip me down to my core, while also offering myself the opportunity to prove what I'm capable of. To all the superfans out there, never give up.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you think you'll ""survive"" <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I've been underestimated my entire life, and the second you tell me I can't do something, I'm going to do my damnedest to prove everyone wrong. I know what it's like to be at the bottom. Things might not always go my way, but I've learned to push through the challenges and work my way to the top. I'm tenacious, a hard worker, and I don't take anything for granted. Applying to the show for so many years has made me stronger, and hungrier to win. I have something to prove, and I will win because I have the passion and desire to do so.</div>"

<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong> Personable, determined and caring.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>When did you first watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Season finale of Season 1. Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Do you still watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Always.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
My parents, Alan and Susie. Also, Jeff Probst.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What does <em>Survivor</em> mean to you and your family?</strong><br/>
Everything. <em>Survivor</em> has been a constant in my life, and kept my family close before, during, and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some, but <em>Survivor</em> is far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope, it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams, and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is one way playing <em>Survivor</em> changed your life?</strong><br/>
My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam. <em>Survivor</em> turned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately, I believe that I am, at my core, the same person that I was when I played <em>Survivor</em> for the first time. Same values, ambitions, passions, and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>As <em>Survivor</em> approaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television, what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?</strong><br/>
I grew up watching Sandra, Boston Rob, Ethan, Tina, Amber, and Richard Hatch. Playing in Season 40 is like growing up watching Steve Young and Jerry Rice on your favorite football team and then getting to play against them in the Super Bowl. It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands of <em>Survivor</em> super-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>How will you play differently than you did in your past season?</strong><br/>
My basic strategy is the same for <em>Survivor</em> as it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing, ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships, keep an eye out for others doing the same, and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.<br/>
<br/>
This time around, I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos, especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated, with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that, while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.</div>"

<br/>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong>Â Compassionate, neurotic, and funny. I'm really, really funny.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>When did you first watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I've been watching since Richard Hatch first took advantage of CBS' ability to pixelate a moving image.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Do you still watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I wouldn't miss it for the world!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
Helping people in big and small ways. From working with big organizations that help kids stay healthy, like Grassroot Soccer, to speaking with patients about surviving and thriving in life after a cancer diagnosis.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What does <em>Survivor</em> mean to you and your family?</strong><br/>
My nieces and nephews are going to flip out and have some major bragging rights in the hallways.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is one way playing <em>Survivor</em> changed your life?</strong><br/>
Oh, let me count the ways! In the ""pinball machine"" of life, one thing can change everything about a person's life. Survivor was that one thing. It gave me opportunities that I only dreamed of, I got to see the world, help make small differences in people's lives, got to meet incredible people across the globe, and brought joy and laughter to my family from all the crazy stories I got to tell after each adventure.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>As <em>Survivor</em> approaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television, what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?</strong><br/>
19 years ago I got let go from a job, had a day off in NYC, and sent a VHS audition tape into CBS on a lark the day before it was due. What happened next literally changed the trajectory of my life. This show has brought happiness and memories to so many people around the world, and it's cool to be a small part of that.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>How will you play differently than you have in your past seasons?</strong><br/>
The last time I played this game was in 2004 on <em>Survivor: All Stars</em>... there were no Idols, hidden clues, advantages, or ways to get back into the game. And get thisâwe actually had to survive! The game has changed and so have I. I plan to adapt, have fun and push my mind, body, and spirit to the max.</div>"

<strong>Do you still watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
YES!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
Health and happiness.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What does <em>Survivor</em> mean to you and your family?</strong><br/>
To me <em>Survivor</em> was a test of my mental, physical, and emotional strength. It also made me realize how much my family (Nadiya) means to me and that nothing motivates me more than that. To my family, <em>Survivor</em> meant pride in having a daughter that was strong, bold, and resilient. Also, to be the first person of South East Asia to be on the show and win was pretty sweet.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is one way playing <em>Survivor</em> changed your life?</strong><br/>
To know that my determination and unwavering dedication can pay off. And no matter how bleak a situation may seem, that if you are focused and work hard it will pay off. It made me proud of my physical and mental strength. It made me confident in my independence and to always stand up for what you believe in and what you deserve in real life and in the game of <em>Survivor</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>As <em>Survivor</em> approaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television, what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?</strong><br/>
It seems almost surreal that I am a part of this legacy. I am honored and grateful to have had this experience and that the fans of the show embraced me as a winner that deserved the title of Sole Survivor. To be a female winner and to be praised for being strong BOTH physically and mentally, bold and unapologetic means so much to me.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>How will you play differently than you did in your past season?</strong><br/>
There are so many factors that are in play in the game of <em>Survivor</em>. It would be stupid for me to even try and start my gameplay ahead of time. But, given the fact that I never got one single vote against me during my season, I don't think I should change much about intuition and game. I am proud of standing up for myself, for being brass and bold, for being strong and ruthless. I know to win <em>Survivor</em> you have to work hard but I also know that there are added factors like timing and luck that can help. Hoping for a little luck, some good timing, and my hard work to bring me success just like my first season.</div>"

<strong>When did you first watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
When I was familiarizing myself with the game right before the first season I played (Season 18). I haven't missed any episodes other than those on seasons I was on after my vote out, because I'm petty.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Do you still watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Of course.<br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Who is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
My daughters. If I could get as excited at anything as they do about a passing airplane or the moon I'd be crushing life.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What does <em>Survivor</em> mean to you and your family?</strong><br/>
<em>Survivor</em> has afforded me the luxury of spending lots of time with my kids. For which I will always be grateful.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is one way playing <em>Survivor</em> changed your life?</strong><br/>
Opened lots of doors to pursue many different interests. Met many lifelong friends and gave me something to focus on every single moment my brain has some downtime.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>As <em>Survivor</em> approaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television, what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?</strong><br/>
I'm honestly honored and proud to be a part of such a milestone. I would have been secretly a bit hurt had I not been included even though I'd pretend not to care.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>How will you play differently than you have in your past seasons?</strong><br/>
I think players will be watching for a sarcastic, cutting, almost aggressive personality who steals food. I'll have to make it SEEM like I am none of those or like I have chilled out a bit, because I have... or have I?</div>"

<br/>
<strong>When did you first watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
<em>Survivor: The Australian Outback</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Do you still watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
It's difficult to find time to watch anything being a wife, mother of two VERY active boys, and a business owner but I watch what I can!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
One of my grandmother's best friends, Elizabeth Pascuzzi. From the time I was a young girl until the day she passed she would tell me, ""You're a winner."" I even brought with me a letter she had written me many years ago as inspiration before entering this round of <em>Survivor</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What does <em>Survivor</em> mean to you and your family?</strong><br/>
One of my strongest memories of my stepfather (who I called dad) was watching <em>Survivor</em> with him. He was the one who encouraged me to try out. When Jeff announced my name as the winner of Season 11, you can see me running to him first and giving him a big hug. He passed away two years ago. So, <em>Survivor</em> will always be our game.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is one way playing <em>Survivor</em> changed your life?</strong><br/>
It made me realize how little we need to survive and how far I could push myself both physically and mentally.<br/>

<strong>As <em>Survivor</em> approaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television, what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?</strong><br/>

<br/>
<strong>When did you first watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
May 31, 2000. I was 10 years old. My dad was writing a book about islands and thought the show was a ""documentary"" so made us watch for ""research.""<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Do you still watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Religiously.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
My grandmother. She'sÂ 90 andÂ brilliant,Â effortlessly cooksÂ dinner for 12, reuses postal stamps, gardens, paints beautifully,Â andÂ writes IN CAPS LOCK FOR EFFECT.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What does <em>Survivor</em> mean to you and your family?</strong><br/>
To me, being a <em>Survivor</em> fan means that I get to live two lives at once. In one life, I spend my week working, cooking, exercising and sleeping... but in the other, I'm watching previews and catching up on behind-the-scenes on Mondays (research for my pool-pick), rushing home to watch live and follow along with the Know-it-Alls on Wednesdays, waking up early on Thursdays to soak in theÂ Ponderosa edits, and debating the merits of ""big moves"" during long walks with my fiancÃ© on Saturdays.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is one way playing <em>Survivor</em> changed your life?</strong><br/>
<em>Survivor</em> built my confidence, giving me theÂ gutsÂ to deviate from a more traditional path (I chose not to become a doctor after graduating medical school), and pursue a more uncertain career.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>As <em>Survivor</em> approaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television, what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?</strong><br/>
It's still so surreal to me that I was basically sucked into the screen of my favorite TV show and am beyond grateful and humbled to be etched intoÂ theÂ <em>Survivor</em> canon, hanging onâhowever precariouslyâin the top 25 of Dalton Ross' winner rankings and on the tails of some of my favorite players of all time. Tony! Tom! Kim! Ethan!Â Cochran!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>How will you play differently than you did in your past season?</strong><br/>
I hope to be less afraid of failure, more open to taking risks, and more embracing of, rather than frustrated by, unknown variables in the game.</div>"

My family. I want my kids to grow up looking up to me and being proud to call me dad.<br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>What does <em>Survivor</em> mean to you and your family?</strong><br/>
It is the only show on television that is suitable and entertaining for everyone in the family. <em>Survivor</em> night is a chance for the family to slow down a hectic schedule and just hang out for one night.<br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>What is one way playing <em>Survivor</em> changed your life?</strong><br/>
Emotionallyâit brought me closer to my wife and kids. When you miss the ones you love, you appreciate them more. Financiallyâit helped me put away for my children's future.<br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>As <em>Survivor</em> approaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television, what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?</strong><br/>
I'm in awe that I am considered for such a monumental season. After Season 31, I pulled away from being a super fan and just enjoyed the show as a casual viewer but the thought of going out there for the GREATEST SEASON EVER gives me chills and I want to cement my name as one of the greats.<br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>How will you play differently than you have in your past seasons?</strong><br/>
Let's just throw out my Season 29 performance... that never happened. I will look to add to my Season 31 game plan. I will keep my meat shields but I will add mind shields and social shields to give me a broader pool of players to align myself with. With this broader pool, I will continue with voting blocks and keep alliance paranoia on 100! I want to take it all in. I feel my last experience was a whirlwind and I forget a lot of experiences. This time I want to try and take some time to enjoy this last go-round.</div>"

I'm humbled and grateful to be a part of a passion for everyone who has worked on <em>Survivor</em> and been a part of <em>Survivor</em> for the last 20 years. It's truly a team effort! I am just a little gear in an amazing machine that we all know and love as <em>Survivor</em>!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>How will you play differently than you did in your past season?</strong><br/>
More humbled and patient. That being said, when it's time to hit the gas pedal, if you ain't first, you're last!</div>"

<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong>Â Feisty, fun, and free spirited.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>When did you first watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I started watching Season 1 at the age of 10.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Do you still watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Absolutely! In my completely unbiased opinion, it's the greatest TV show of all time.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
My family inspires me every day. They are the most thoughtful, funny, and loving people I have ever met and they always push me to be better.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What does <em>Survivor</em> mean to you and your family?</strong><br/>
My family and IÂ have always watched <em>Survivor</em> togetherÂ so it is pretty sentimental. Being on the show has also allowed me to be involved with the <em>Survivor</em> community and I am lucky enough to call many of them my friends.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is one way playing <em>Survivor</em> changed your life?</strong><br/>
Winning <em>Survivor</em> gave me the confidence to know that I can do anything I set my mind to.Â I did not win by being the smartest or strongest; I won by being myself. I think realizing that in my mid-20s was really pivotal in shaping how I handle challenges.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>As <em>Survivor</em> approaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television, what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?</strong><br/>
As a super fan, I am absolutely honored to be a small part of a huge legacy. Winning my first season was surreal. Now, I get to return with winners that I admire... I am pinching myself.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>How will you play differently than you did in your past season?</strong><br/>
I don't think I will play much differently. In my first season, I learned that I am able to calmly adapt to changing circumstances andÂ this is valuable in a game where paranoia runs rampant.Â Since I am a social player, I will lean into that and make as many personal connections as possible. I would like to make some fun, big moves this time but they have to be smart and not just for shock factor.<br/>
<br/>
The one thing that feels really important is advocating for my own story so that at the final Tribal I have a compelling narrative. Lately, we have seen a trend of strong, confident males winning <em>Survivor</em> so I want to show that you can have a different approach and still be worthy of the title SoleÂ Survivor. The pressure is on this season because everyone wants to prove they are the best to ever play the game so I am expecting fireworks and lots of big moves.</div>"

<strong>Hobbies:</strong>Â Playing basketball, traveling, and playing with my niece and nephew.<br/>
Â <br/>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong>Â Determined, inspirational, and loving.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>When did you first watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Season 18 â <em>Survivor: Tocantins</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Do you still watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
My parents are my inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What does <em>Survivor</em> mean to you and your family?</strong><br/>
To me, it is a decade-long dream turned into reality. My family saw it as one of those crazy dreams of mine, and they supported it with curiosity. When they realized how serious I took <em>Survivor</em>, and that I was pretty good at it, they threw their full support behind me. For that, I'm super grateful.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is one way playing <em>Survivor</em> changed your life?</strong><br/>
It made me much busier. I give more talks, travel more, and give back more than I had before. Before I made lots of custom furniture for Beve Unlimited and traveled a little for deliveries. Now I still make lots of furniture, but I'm traveling globally for other sorts of opportunities, as well.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>As <em>Survivor</em> approaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television, what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?</strong><br/>
The best season ever was the 10 year anniversary: Season 20, <em>Heroes vs Villains</em>. This will be yet another huge season: Season 40, <em>Winners At War</em>, the first all-winners season. To be a part of it, I'm part of the <em>Survivor</em> legacy, and that's something that I've always wanted to accomplish. So I'm just humbled, honored, and grateful to be out here again.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>How will you play differently than you did in your past season?</strong><br/>
Last time I was playing for a lot of people back home. I wanted to play it safe to represent well for my family, community, and loved ones back home. I wanted to leave something my little cousins and my niece and nephew could see and be proud of. They have that; I did that. This time I want to loosen up a bit and have some fun out there. Backstab a little bit, and talk even more trash. Shoot at some big dogs, and pull some tricks out. Maybe even do some things that are out of character. Let's see who's out here to really play the game.</div>"

<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong>Â Empathetic, introverted, and idealistic.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>When did you first watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
<em>Survivor: Borneo</em>!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Do you still watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
I once heard someone say that the richness of a person's life isn't measured by money, but by the people in it. I felt inspired by this back then, and continue to believe it today.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What does <em>Survivor</em> mean to you and your family?</strong><br/>
I owe my family to <em>Survivor</em>. I met my wife after we were set up by Brad Virata (my Tribemate from <em>Cook Islands</em>) and now we have two beautiful girls who just watched <em>Survivor</em> for the first time!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is one way playing <em>Survivor</em> changed your life?</strong><br/>
Winning <em>Survivor</em> gave me a platform for raising awareness of issues I care about, from diversity in media, to the need for more minority bone marrow donors, to the importance of civic and political engagement. It also gave me a lifelong aversion to eating coconuts.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>As <em>Survivor</em> approaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television, what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?</strong><br/>
It's gratifying to be part of something that changed the media landscape and brought more diversity onscreen to mainstream audiences. <em>Survivor</em> showed that, regardless of gender or ethnic differences, we're all human beings who share a common capacity for connection, inspiration, and glee over well-executed blindsides.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>How will you play differently than you did in your past season?</strong><br/>
When I played on <em>Cook Islands</em>, I felt as though I had to walk on eggshells and monitor every word, especially in light of the surprise theme for that season. Now that I'm free of those constraints, I'm just gonna let it rip!</div>"

<br/>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong>Â Determined, competitive, and street smart.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>When did you first watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I've watched <em>Survivor</em> since the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Do you still watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Every Wednesday my family sits down and watches <em>Survivor</em> together.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
Not one specific person, but anyone who is willing to try. If you never try the answer is always no. People who are not afraid of failure because they believe they can succeed inspire me.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What does <em>Survivor</em> mean to you and your family?</strong><br/>
<em>Survivor</em> means the world to my family; it has made our lives much easier financially.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is one way playing <em>Survivor</em> changed your life?</strong><br/>
Enduring the mental, emotional, and physical aspects of the game made me realize how powerful your mind and attitude are. <em>Survivor</em> changed me by teaching me that anything is possible! There is NOTHING I can't accomplish.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>As <em>Survivor</em> approaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television, what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?</strong><br/>
40 seasons is absolutely insane! I am honored and humbled to be chosen to play three times.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>How will you play differently than you have in your past seasons?</strong><br/>
The past two seasons I've had a game plan going into the season. I've now played two completely different games, one being loyal and one being a flip-flopper. I feel like the best approach to this season is going to be psychological warfare to create paranoia and have people self-destruct.</div>"

<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong>Â Dedicated mom/wife<br/>
<br/>
<strong>When did you first watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Watched from the beginning, Season 1.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
Family, my husband Rob and four daughters.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Do you still watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Yes. I've seen every season and now watch it with my family every week.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What does <em>Survivor</em> mean to you and your family?</strong><br/>
Now that our kids are old enough to watch the show... it means enjoying family night while eating Doritos and watching <em>Survivor</em>. It's a lot of fun!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is one way playing <em>Survivor</em> changed your life?</strong><br/>
I met my husband on the show and the rest is history.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>As <em>Survivor</em> approaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television, what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?</strong><br/>
Never expecting to play again... had sort of closed that book. So now that it is open again... it's both nerve-wracking and exciting to ""get back into the game"" and not just watching as a fan, as I've been doing for the past 15 years. I'm so excited that my girls will not just hear about Mommy and Daddy being on <em>Survivor</em>. Now they will actually be a part of our story and get to watch the season with us when it airs. It's an honor to be a part of another epic season!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>How will you play differently than you have in past seasons?</strong><br/>
A lot of time has passed since I last played <em>Survivor</em>. Heck, it's been 20 years since I played the first time on Season 2. Not only has the game evolved and changed a lot... so have I. I'm no longer just playing for myself. I'm married with four children who will be closely watching and listening to everything I do and every word I speak. I'm 20 years older too. I was the youngest in my Tribe when I played <em>Survivor: The Australian Outback</em>. Now, I'm going to be one of the ""older"" people. People see me in a whole new light. Plus, being married to ""Boston Rob"" paints a HUGE target on my back. When I played the first two times, I didn't have that pressure. So, I guess for me I'm going to try to focus on my social game in a big way and try hard to find Idols/advantages! I'd like to think I'll be good at challenges but let's face it, I am not in the shape I was before having four kids. But I also want to focus on enjoying the experience and showing my girls how strong their mom is! I'll never give up and I'll show them to always go big and finish what you start. And in the end, hopefully, win it again!</div>"

<strong>When did you first watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
When Stephanie LaGrossa crushed Palau.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Do you still watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I do.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
One time I met a man in the Atlanta airport who had two prosthetic legs. He was in a wheelchair and traveling with an infant and his toddlerâand zero support crew. He was smiling. That man blew my mind.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What does <em>Survivor</em> mean to you and your family?</strong><br/>
<em>Survivor</em> is my family. My husband competed on Season 29, and I thought he was cute when I saw him on TV. Then we met in real life at a Grassroot Soccer charity soccer tournament hosted by Ethan Zohn, winner of <em>Survivor: Africa</em>. And now we have a <em>Survivor</em> baby. It's kind of absurd, really.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is one way that playing <em>Survivor</em> changed your life?</strong><br/>
It opened up the competitive beast within, and it also gave me the opportunity to host TV shows, travel around the world as a journalist, and take pics with really excited fans at airports. I played three seasons when I was in my 20s and then processed my experiences for the last decade. I think the main reason that I am able to help people with my work as a life coach and yoga teacher is because I came through such intense experiences playing and winning <em>Survivor</em> and then afterward with the criticism and reality TV fame. I know what it's like to go after a goal with everything I have. I know in my bones how hard it is to be judged and found lacking. I know the sting of betrayal, and I also know that miracles happen all the time. No matter what it looks like, there is a way through every block.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>As <em>Survivor</em> approaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television, what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?</strong><br/>
I am pumped. I thought I was done, but this opportunity to compete with the best of the best is too good to pass up. The game has changed. It's faster, more complex, and people are bolder. I'm excited to get into this more dynamic arena and win a totally new game.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>How will you play differently than you have in your past seasons?</strong><br/>
I'm sure I will be targeted again right away, like I was on <em>Heroes vs. Villains</em>. So, this time I will have to take into consideration that I may be on the outside looking in at first. There also may be some people playing with me that I have history withâprobably not good historyâand I will have to clear my mind and see them as totally new, like we're meeting for the first time. I plan to be more aggressive and sneaky in hunting idols, distributing misinformation, letting other people lead and take credit, and really play up that I'm a new mom. I'm definitely not in as good of physical shape as I was the last few times I played, but I have a new stamina and capacity that comes from knowing that I can survive six months of sleep deprivation with a newborn. And, I know that I can connect with people in a completely different way as a mother.</div>"

<strong>Do you still watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>

<strong>What does <em>Survivor</em> mean to you and your family?</strong><br/>

<br/>
<strong>What is one way playing <em>Survivor</em> changed your life?</strong><br/>
I needed a reset button for my own self-confidence and just in life in general. <em>Survivor</em> was the perfect thing at the perfect time; I believe it changed my trajectory going forward.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>As <em>Survivor</em> approaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television, what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?</strong><br/>

<br/>
<strong>How will you play differently than you did in your past season?</strong><br/>
My life has changed tremendously in the last seven years. My first go-round I was 28 and newly single, I coveted the escape and the adventure of <em>Survivor</em>. Since then, I got married and had three babies as fast as humanly possible. I think this will perhaps change everything about the way I play, I just don't know exactly how. My plan is to take this new season as a completely new and separate experience from the last!</div>"

<br/>
<strong>When did you first watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
I started watching <em>Survivor</em> in 2000 with my husband Brad.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Do you still watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Ummmmm, yes!!! Every Wednesday.... work, activities, and life in general is planned often around our Wednesday night family viewing!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
This hasn't changed for me and I continue to be inspired by anyone who embraces life with passion. When you see it... you can feel it... and you can't help but be impacted and inspired by it.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What does <em>Survivor</em> mean to you and your family?</strong><br/>
<em>Survivor</em> is something that is a shared experience for all of us. We've laughed, we've cried... and we've hooted and hollered at our TV many times over the years. It's the one time where we don't just slow downâwe stop and are all focused 100% on the same thing. It's our time.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is one way playing <em>Survivor</em> changed your life?</strong><br/>
I think <em>Survivor</em> has changed my life in many ways... but not because of the money. At the core, I remain the person I was before, which until very recently included driving the SAME car, now almost 12 years old, complete with dents and duct tape patching. But playing <em>Survivor</em> fueled parts of me that were always there, maybe untapped, or maybe pushed me to honor those parts. It's made me more open to life experiences in general, fueled the desire to travel, and now plays a huge part in our family motto of #GoSeeDo (go places we don't normally get to go, see people we don't normally get to see, do things we wouldn't normally do). Ultimately, it was a reminder that life is too short, so suck it up during the crappy parts, and embrace and appreciate the rest.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>As <em>Survivor</em> approaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television, what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?</strong><br/>
It's funny, this answer should be easy... but it's not. Being given the chance to play a second time is huge in and of itself. But for it to be the 40th! EPIC! The game has changed SO much since Season 1 and has brought with it so many incredible players. It feels like a huge honor to be able to be a part of that legacy (even if I was on one of the worst tribes EVER!) so I don't take it lightly.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>How will you play differently than you did in your past season?</strong><br/>
My honest answer... I have no clue! LOL! Why?? Because we are who we are, good or bad, and once you're out on that island... all of the best-laid plans, intentions, etc. can quickly dissipate into a miserable mess. So in truth, the core of how I played the first time will remain: adapt, adapt, adapt. And hope that the <em>Survivor</em> ""gods"" are in my favor.</div>"

<br/>
<strong>As <em>Survivor</em> approaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television, what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?</strong><br/>
It's truly as surreal as it was for me the very first time I played. I'm genuinely humbled that <em>Survivor</em> looks at me as one of their top winners, so much that they would invite me back to play again not once, but TWICE! Being a part of this unimaginable milestone of a season is HUGE!<br/>

I've played <em>Survivor</em> twice (Season 28 and 34)âI won once, and lost once. I've learned that my game-winning performance was similar to that of a one-trick pony. There is no way I can perform the same tricks playing with <em>Survivor</em> legends and expect to get away with it. Hence my second time playing on <em>Game Changers</em>. Fortunately for me, I'm well aware that I will have to change the way that I'm wired. I will play this season differently by not being as loud/flashy and will try my best to control the votes/game without making it obvious that I'm doing just that. Wish me luck! LOL!</div>"

<br/>
<strong>Three words to describe you:</strong>Â Charming, cunning, and cheeky.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>When did you first watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Season 1 finale.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Do you still watch <em>Survivor</em>?</strong><br/>
Every Wednesday! I am even considering starting a <em>Survivor</em> podcast.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your inspiration in life?</strong><br/>
Sandra, because I want to be the next two-time winner.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What does <em>Survivor</em> mean to you and your family?</strong><br/>
<em>Survivor</em> has helped me through hard times. For example, it was a great escape from the stresses of law school. And on a more serious note, I specifically remember when my mom had recently passed away, I was moved by Rodney grieving the loss of his sister on Season 30. I bawled my eyes out. It was a much-needed therapeutic experience.<br/>
<br/>
My family has always watched <em>Survivor</em> and tried to watch it together when we could. When my dad came to Fiji for the family visit, it was a monumental experience that strengthened our relationship. Because of that moment, we are still closer to this day.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is one way playing <em>Survivor</em> changed your life?</strong><br/>
It made me realize what is important in life. I don't have to focus my career on making money. I can focus my life on my family and my career on helping people.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>As <em>Survivor</em> approaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television, what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?</strong><br/>
It is a dream come true for me to be a part of the 20-year celebration of <em>Survivor</em>. Only two years ago, I was daydreaming about how I could ever even get the opportunity to be cast on the show. Now, I am the winner of one of <em>Survivor</em>'s greatest seasons, and I am placed in the same category as the legends I used to look up to! It is a great honor. I am a <em>Survivor</em> legend! How amazing! What a blessing!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>How will you play differently than in your past season?</strong><br/>
When I won <em>David vs. Goliath</em>, I never received a single vote against me. I was able to disguise my strategic ability and knowledge of the game under my country accent and chill demeanor. I was able to fly under the radar and build one-on-one relationships with nearly every single player in the game. This time, if I don't receive a single vote the entire game, I will take it as an insult! Everyone has seen how brilliantly I play <em>Survivor</em>. These legends won't fall for alliance names and my Kentucky charm as easily as a cast of complete strangers did. I won't be able to hide behind bigger threats. So this time, I'm going to be even more aggressive. In short, I am going to have as much fun as possible in the beginning. This is my dream come trueÂ and I want to take it all in. Then, I am going to TURN IT ON. No player will be safe from the Kentucky Nick sneaky ninja assassin blindside! This game is where legends are made!</div>"

<strong>3 Words to Describe You:</strong> Spontaneous, Practical, Patient<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Pet Peeve:</strong> Lack of initiative<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> My family. I'm very proud of my wife<br/>
of 21 years and 4 kids.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong> I'm a private pilot and enjoy<br/>
flying. I've nearly died from a rattlesnake bite, been blown up by a propane tank and I like to<br/>
live life on the edge.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> My Dad. I worked side by side with him nearly every day my<br/>
entire life. He was a father, boss and friend and, even after battling cancer for five years, he<br/>
always kept a positive, generous attitude.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> Boston Rob. We don't have the same<br/>
personality, but his thoughtful, strategic play is how I see myself playing.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can win Survivor?</strong> I have all the skills of a typical rancher â hard-<br/>
working, common sense-but I'm completely different because of my social skills. I believe I can<br/>
build multi-dimensional alliances and win trust with most people, but with laser vision towards<br/>
the end goal.</div>"

<strong>Occupation:</strong> Ex-NFL Player<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Hobbies:</strong> Competing, traveling, cooking<br/>
<br/>
<strong>3 Words to Describe You:</strong> Competitive, charismatic, optimistic<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Pet Peeve:</strong> Lying, not being on time and lack of accountability. Lack of awareness and<br/>
consideration for people's time and space or having to repeat myself after three times.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> Completing my graduate degree<br/>
program! It was my goal to earn an MBA before I made it to the NFL, but that changed due to<br/>
the money I was making and the workload that football requires. After retirement I had to<br/>
overcome my own mind and doubts that I couldn't do it. It was the hardest thing I've ever done<br/>
in life â late nights of studying and having tutors almost giving up repeatedly. But I never did, I<br/>
have my MBA!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong> You would never know that I<br/>
often achieve success because of fear, my fear of letting the people that I love down. Letting<br/>
down people that took a chance on me is the vision that I use to thrive in competitive situations.<br/>
Very similar to Adam Sandler in the movie ""The Water Boy.""<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> My mom. When my father passed, she was left to take care of<br/>
three kids alone. She worked two jobs plus side work to provide for us. There is nothing she<br/>
wouldn't do for us. I take strength to be strong when a tragedy hits from her, she never<br/>
complained or let us see her cry. She did that for us. I owe her everything that I can give.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> Ben ""Boom"" Driebergen, 1 Big<br/>
Move King. I figure that I would be seen as a strong physical player so I would eventually<br/>
become a big target. The way Ben was able to outwork everyone on the tribe and do what he<br/>
needed to do in order to survive was truly admirable. It's that 'back against the wall' mentality I<br/>
admire.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can win Survivor?</strong> I'm applying to win. I always have something to prove to<br/>
myself. I truly believe that I can succeed at whatever I put my mind to. I haven't failed<br/>
yet and don't plan on starting now.</div>"

<strong>Age: 35</strong><br/>
<strong>Hometown:</strong> Highland, CA<br/>
<strong>Current Residence:</strong> Chicago, IL<br/>
<strong>Occupation:</strong> Neurosurgeon<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Hobbies:</strong> Traveling, snowboarding, eating<br/>
<br/>
<strong>3 Words to Describe You:</strong> Determined, passionate, stubborn<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Pet Peeve:</strong> My pet peeves revolve around people's incompetence, laziness and lack of self-<br/>
awareness.When you work an insane number of hours in a week, you just can't tolerate pure<br/>
ineptness.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> Hands down I'm most proud of<br/>
becoming a neurosurgeon that focuses on treating the brain cancer that claimed my father's life.<br/>
No one in my family is in healthcare and no one in my family has left our area in Southern<br/>
California. Becoming a physician, let alone a neurosurgeon, just wasn't something that was done<br/>
in my community and was not something that seemed achievable as a kid.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong> Despite a confident exterior,<br/>
I still have and process a lot of emotional baggage. As with all neurosurgeons, I have a ""trail of<br/>
tears"" that I have to cope with on a routine basis.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> My mom is my hero. She raised me and my sister herself after my<br/>
father passed. She has sacrificed so much and worked so hard so that I could shoot for my<br/>
dreams. She never pressured me to do or be anything; she just wanted me to be the best that I could be.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> I would play with a similar<br/>
aggressive nature as Russell Hantz. He was aggressive, but his social assimilation needed work.<br/>
Todd Herzog had a brilliant social game. He did in final tribal what Russell couldn't. I know<br/>
how to pander to people and make them feel valuable even if I don't believe it. I would<br/>
dominate in final tribal. Natalie Anderson also had a brilliant social game, she made big moves<br/>
and covered her tracks perfectly. Kelley Wentworth was aggressive and had an uncanny ability<br/>
to read her surroundings, and so do I. Cirie Fields is the master of this game. If she was a<br/>
little more athletic, she would dominate. Her social ability and her social awareness is amazing. She<br/>
relates to people and makes them feel comfortable. She's calm and doesn't appear to be overly<br/>
aggressive.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can win Survivor?</strong> I will be the sole Survivor because I possess<br/>
an ideal balance of charm, wit, athleticism and grit. Neurosurgery training has prepared me to push<br/>
myself physically and emotionally beyond what is normal. As a neurosurgeon I have to be<br/>
charming, relatable and able to connect with my patients, who place their identity and lives<br/>
literally in my hands. I know how to be cool under stress. In neurosurgery the stakes are<br/>
incredibly high and the only person I can trust to get the job done is myself. In ""Survivor,"" you<br/>
always have to assume that people are trying to screw you over. I am extremely athletic and<br/>
work out twice a day. However, I am not a ""jock"" or ""golden boy"" like Joey Amazing, Malcolm<br/>
or Ozzy, who will always be targets because of their persona. I can also be extremely eloquent<br/>
and persuasive â my final tribal council will rival the likes of Todd Herzog's.</div>"

<br/>
<strong>Hobbies:</strong> Cooking, making music, playing tennis<br/>
<br/>
<strong>3 Words to Describe You:</strong> Charming, devious, resilient<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Pet Peeve:</strong> My biggest pet peeve is being told what to do. And it's not something that makes me<br/>
mildly irritated, I deeply loathe being told what to do. Listen, I'm not saying I know it all, but I'd<br/>
much rather try and fail at something than go along with what someone else tells me is<br/>
""acceptable.""<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong>Â Every time I set a new goal and<br/>
accomplish it, I become most proud of that goal. Most recently, I'm most proud to be in medical<br/>
school, with a master's and bachelor's degree under my belt. I sense that within this next year<br/>
I'll be most proud of winning ""Survivor.""<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong> You'd probably never know<br/>
that I am very introspective and empathetic. Around people, I am always so outgoing, but I'm<br/>
also someone who thinks a lot, sometimes overthinks and over feels, for other people and<br/>
sometimes my own situations. I consider myself an empath and although I may not always<br/>
appear to, I do feel other people's emotions and I do feel strong emotions myself. I think I just do<br/>
an above average job at concealing these emotions to not look vulnerable.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> My heroes are my parents because they truly took parenting<br/>
personally. They both come from challenging backgrounds and made it their duty to create<br/>
a better life for my siblings and me. But above all, I find it most heroic that they are and somehow<br/>
raised five genuinely good human beings, with good hearts and strong moral compasses. That<br/>
can be hard to come by these days.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> Well I mean let's be real here, my<br/>
game will be unprecedented! But I see my game being most like Cirie Fields socially and<br/>
mentally, with a sprinkle of Wendell for pulling out competition wins in the clutch and jury<br/>
management. I'll be like Cirie and Wendell's love child!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can win Survivor?</strong> I believe I could be the final Survivor because of a<br/>
combination of social, mental and physical skills. I studied the game of ""Survivor"" like I would<br/>
study for a medical school test and what I have found is that in order to outwit, outplay<br/>
and outlast, you must have all three skills and these skills must work harmoniously together and<br/>
shine at different points in the game. I feel like I am self-aware, which is something a lot of<br/>
people lack. I am analytical enough to pick up on social cues and smart enough to critically think<br/>
through obstacles that may present themselves, without becoming flustered. I know that I'm<br/>
physically enough to help my team do well in challenges in the beginning and <em>win</em> challenges<br/>
past the merge, but also, cunning enough to get any physical threats voted out before the game<br/>
becomes individual. I am persuasive, but non-threatening. I have street smarts and book smarts<br/>
and am empathetic enough to be read as trustworthy. I truly feel like I have the recipe to win!</div>"

examining the surface of the moon, stars or passing comets with my very own telescope.Â <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> My hero is my grandfather, a man that didn't have to say a word to<br/>
speak volumes. I would watch him walk into a room and respect was given to him before he<br/>
uttered a word. He showered his grandchildren with affection and love that can only be given<br/>
from the heart. The lessons that he shared with me were instrumental in my development and<br/>
made me into the man I am today. My grandfather passed during my third week of basic Air<br/>
Force training, but he remains a constant figure in my life.Â <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong>Â Â I would construct a hybrid playing<br/>
styleÂ of Richard Hatch and Wendell Holland with a touch of Boston Rob.Â <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can win Survivor? </strong>I was taught to always dream big and shoot higher<br/>
than you know you can do. Don't bother just to be better than your contemporaries or<br/>
predecessors, try to be better than yourself. The game is not only my motivation, it's my tool to<br/>

<br/>
<strong>Pet Peeves:</strong> Ignorance and men in ill-fitting jeans<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> It's hard to pick one because I love my<br/>
whole life.<br/>
My goal was to pay off my student loans by 30, and I did it at 27. Doing so allowed me to travel<br/>
to so many places on my bucket list, get into combat sports and create financial stability for<br/>
myself. One of my biggest accomplishments is actually leaving my job before coming to Fiji for<br/>
the game. I'm proud of the career I built for nearly a decade. I'm even more proud that I was<br/>
brave and walked away when I wasn't passionate about it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong> People are always surprised<br/>
by how smart and articulate I am. I'm quite smart and figure things out quickly. I'm also quick-<br/>
witted and those who get it are pleasantly surprised. Those who don't, have no clue what they're<br/>
missing. People also don't believe I'm 5-feet tall because my vibes make me seem 5'3"".<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> My grandma. She lived with my family growing up and I have<br/>
a tattoo inspired by her. She [was] strong willed, so chic, sweet, yet opinionated and caring. She<br/>
had my back 100% of the time. During her final days in the hospital she was still so high-<br/>
maintenance and always made the nurses put on her pearls and diamonds.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> Brenda on the outside, Todd<br/>
underneath. Brenda is physically strong, socially aware and not afraid to show her teeth. Todd is<br/>
my all-time favorite player. I can channel his ability to influence others and always be<br/>
strategically in control of the game and prepare to pitch myself in an amazing jury performance.<br/>
Why do you believe you can win Survivor? I've been manipulative since before I knew what<br/>
manipulation was. I relentlessly pursue my dreams. The great thing is no one would expect<br/>
it because of my youthful face and small stature. I can make it to the end and am confident<br/>
in my ability to advocate for myself at final tribal.</div>"

<strong>3 Words to Describe You:</strong> Extroverted, enthusiastic, smart<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Pet Peeves:</strong> Men. Not all men, but I cannot stand machismo and man-splainers - anything like<br/>
that drives me insane. [In grad school] I deal with A LOT of know-it-all male energy, and it's a<br/>
lot. Back when I dated men, I once broke up with a guy because we were on a trip to Budapest<br/>
and he kept pronouncing it ""Budah-pesht"" to prove how smart and worldly he was, and it was the<br/>
biggest turnoff. I broke up with him literally 30 minutes after we got back from the trip.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> In February 2019 I was featured in an<br/>
episode of the podcast Radiolab (episode ""Asking for a Friend""). I was so proud of it for several<br/>
reasons. One, I absolutely love that podcast and it was so freaking cool to be a part of it. Two, I<br/>
felt like I was really able to bring a lot of myself into the interview. Normally, scientists try to<br/>
keep things very clinical and sterile. That's not my attitude. We talked about Neanderthals, but in<br/>
the discussion, I also brought up the fact that we always seem to imagine Neanderthals as males<br/>
when of course they were females as well. The reporter said, ""Oh maybe I should be imagining<br/>
myself meeting a female Neanderthal at a bar."" Naturally, I replied, ""Well that's my kind of<br/>
story."" She ran with it and had a whole chunk of the episode be about queer interspecies<br/>
romance, which is literally my dream come true.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong> People are normally shocked<br/>
that I passed as straight for 23 years. I give off the vibe of someone super confident in in my<br/>
queerness (which I am now), but it wasn't always this way. I like to be loud and proud<br/>
about that so people know that it's okay to take longer to know yourself. People who know me<br/>
at all are also often incredibly surprised when I say that I'm 5'2"". People are always surprised<br/>
that I'm short. I have a big personality that takes up more than 62 inches of space.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> My hero is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She is just such a badass<br/>
woman and withstands so much hate, sexism, racism, ageism and somehow never gives up or<br/>
gives in. I so admire the way that she stands up for regular people and against huge opposition<br/>
from powerful forces with just her voice, passion and beliefs. I genuinely cried when watching<br/>
her speech after a Republican congressman called her a bitch. She stood there in Congress, so<br/>
poised and dignified, yet still so clearly channeling intense fiery passion against abusive men and<br/>
for women everywhere who have to deal with that BS. She said, ""having daughters is not what<br/>
makes someone a decent man. Treating people with dignity and respect is what makes a decent<br/>
man."" That's just so true and clear and makes me feel seen by a politician for the first time ever.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> I think the strategy that would work<br/>
well for me would be staying close to the center of power, but never directly perceived as the one<br/>
making the calls. For example, Todd at the beginning of China put Aaron as the leader of his<br/>
tribe, but knew he could control him. I also think Natalie in San Juan Del Sur crushed this. She<br/>
was Jeremy's number two at first, so he was the one that got cut while she stuck around. Then<br/>
she pretended to let Jon Misch et al. be in charge. Ultimately, she struck at the right time and<br/>
was able to get him out and win. I think that would be the type of player I would want to beâ<br/>
I'd want to seem agreeable and like I wasn't playing with intense strategy, but be right next to<br/>
the front-man so that I could grab the reins at the right moment. This plan could blow up if<br/>
you're too in love with the front-man (a la Stephen with J.T. or any non-Kim players in One<br/>
World). You have to know when to betray them.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can win Survivor?</strong> I really think I have the right combination of skills<br/>
to win the game. I'm extremely smart and strategic and know the game very well and will<br/>
constantly be thinking about how to put myself in the best position to win. But I'm also so silly<br/>
and goofy and physically small and clumsy that I think people will really underestimate me and<br/>
not target me. I've got an infectious smile and personality that will help me make great bonds<br/>
with people. I'm super open and vulnerable with people so I think people will feel close to me,<br/>
tell me information and want to work with me. I think people will have warm feelings for me at<br/>
the end of the game even if I vote them out. I'm good at reading people's vibes and am very<br/>
sensitive to shifts in people's energy so I think I'll be able to figure out if people are lying to me<br/>
or planning to betray me. Even though I am very empathetic to people, I also can have a wall up<br/>
in me and always put my closest people above anyone else, and I know I will be able to betray<br/>
someone for the sake of winning the game. I'm also relentlessly optimistic and will not ever<br/>
give up or count myself out.</div>"

<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> Rick Devens â he played so hard with<br/>
everything he had. Even when it was getting bad, he made his time fun! I want to make my<br/>
experience a truly fun adventure, even if only for myself. I want to belly laugh when it's so<br/>
tough. Tina Wesson â she was calculated, direct, but kind. Age and stature and her nurturing<br/>
persona played in her favor, she inspired me. I'd embody the kindness of Lisa Whelchel, but with<br/>
the savviness of Chrissy Hofbeck.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can win Survivor?</strong> I'm sharp and observant, like OCD observant.<br/>
I'm surprisingly very strong and have a ridiculously high threshold for pain. I'm<br/>
resilient. I'm daring but careful. I build strong relationships. I'm likable and entertaining. I listen and learn.<br/>
I will be the person who remembers where everyone is from and what they love on their pizza.<br/>
I'll know their stories â the kids, pets, etc. I may not like them all, but I have the ability to<br/>
convince them all that I do! I'll make people smile when they need to. I hope to make all feel<br/>
included and important.</div>"

<strong>Age:</strong> 20<br/>
<strong>Hometown:</strong> Oklahoma City, OK<br/>
<strong>Current Residence:</strong> Oklahoma City, OK<br/>
<strong>Occupation: College</strong> Student<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Hobbies:</strong> Obviously Survivor, working with kids/pediatric nursing, athletics (jiu jitsu, running,<br/>
dance)<br/>
<br/>
<strong>3 Words to Describe You:</strong> High energy, charming, charismatic<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Pet Peeves:</strong> I really hate bullies, and I don't like loud eating.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> I'm so proud to be a two-time state<br/>
track champion because it is the culmination of seven years of absolute passion, but also pain.<br/>
Literal blood, sweat and tears! Everyone will tell you running is hard, but running with the<br/>
fastest people in the state running sub five minute miles and pole vaulting is a story of its own.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong> When people first<br/>
meet me they always assume I'm the goofy, go with the flow bro who's here to make you laugh.<br/>
But I'm also a lot smarter than people think until they see my grades or hear me speak in front of<br/>
a crowd. I did Toastmasters, a nonprofit educational organization that teaches public speaking<br/>
and leadership, when I was in 6th grade up until high school so I can speak eloquently. Public<br/>
speaking has never been a problem for me.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> Every now and then I volunteer at the children's hospital because<br/>
pediatric nursing is what I want to do with the rest of my life. Those kids are absolutely my<br/>
heroes. To know and see what they go through hurts, and yet they still have a smile on their<br/>
faces. Why would I - someone in perfect health - spend so much time being angry at dumb stuff<br/>
like bad weather, girls or no more milk in my fridge? I'm so much more privileged than they<br/>
are. I will always have a smile on my face and a laugh on the way because why not, right?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> I would love to play the game like the<br/>
culmination of some great Survivor winners, specifically Parvati, Fabio and Jeremy Collins. No<br/>
one in the history of Survivor can charm like Parv. I'm going to change that. I would love to<br/>
have Fabio's ability to be underestimated, which I believe is the best thing you can be in<br/>
Survivor. Lastly, I want to work Jeremy's shield management into my gameplay while still<br/>
having my own king spin on it.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can win Survivor?</strong> I believe that there are numerous aspects of<br/>
Survivor. You'll drive yourself mad trying to do one of them perfectly. If I can do everything<br/>
well enough, I know I can win. I have great social awareness and in high school I was very<br/>
popular. I had my hand in every clique with the jocks, the band kids, musical theatre kids,<br/>
popular kids, rappers, academic kids, ROTC kids, quiet kids and even the teachers loved me.<br/>
Even now, I have a great relationship with the president of our college. I have that ""it"" factor<br/>
that some people just have. I think JT had it and Kim Spradlin, now I have it too.Â </div>"

<strong>Age:</strong> 20<br/>
<strong>Hometown:</strong> Evanston, IL<br/>
<strong>Current Residence:</strong> Washington, DC<br/>
<strong>Occupation: </strong>College Student<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Hobbies:</strong> Dancing, running, writing poetry<br/>
<br/>
<strong>3 Words to Describe You:</strong> Adventurous, loving, outspoken<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Pet Peeves:</strong> I hate when people chew with their mouth open.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> I am most proud of being invited to<br/>
perform my spoken word for Congressman John Lewis during a fundraiser for a non-profit<br/>
organization in my community.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong> Looking at me you would<br/>
never know that I spent a portion of my childhood in Tokyo and Singapore.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> My hero is Misty Copeland, the first female African-American<br/>
dancer to be promoted to a principal dancer for the American Ballet Theatre. I see Misty<br/>
Copeland as a hero because she faced incredible odds growing up in terms of her home life, but<br/>
she also stayed committed to her craft and her love of ballet to get where she is today. In staying<br/>
committed mentally and emotionally to the idea that she could, in fact, be a professional ballet<br/>
dancer even though she didn't fit the archetype of a white ballerina, she broke barriers for future<br/>
Black ballet dancers who had dreams that always seemed unattainable.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> I would hope to play the game most<br/>
like Tony Vlachos, except not have other people know that. Tony was a player that minimized<br/>
risks to the best of his ability. He would always read the social scene and crunch numbers, but if<br/>
he felt like his game was on the line, he would find some way to ensure his safety, whether it<br/>
was finding an idol or slickly attempting to overhear other players' conversations. Although I<br/>
really hated when Tony did that as a viewer, I think his type of game play is one that I would try<br/>
to emulate, but in a way that had more authentic relationships. In all honesty, I would hope to be<br/>
a type of hybrid between Tony and Elaine. I would have Tony's game play skills and Elaine's<br/>
people skills.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can win Survivor?</strong> I believe I can be the final Survivor because too<br/>
often, women of color are overlooked and undervalued. Whether that's in my business classes<br/>
dominated by white men who feel entitled to the space they take up or in future workplaces, it is<br/>
women of color who have nurtured and cared for others throughout history. If there was ever a<br/>
person who was strong enough mentally, physically and emotionally to take on a game full of<br/>
odds â a woman of color, a woman like me and the women I come from would be the one to do<br/>
it.</div>"

<strong>Current Residence:</strong> Morgan Hill, CA<br/>
<strong>Occupation:</strong> Sales Manager<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Hobbies:</strong> Cricket, traveling, cooking<br/>
<br/>
<strong>3 Words to Describe You:</strong> Authentic, outgoing, hardworking<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Pet Peeves:</strong> Laziness and people who don't contribute to group efforts<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> I have achieved the American Dream. I<br/>
grew up in poverty, living in a mud hut with no electricity or running water for half my life. I<br/>
never held a cell phone or touched a computer until I was 18. I worked my way up from selling<br/>
vegetables on the street to making multi-million-dollar sales for my company. I taught myself<br/>
English. I am able to give my kids the life I didn't have growing up and still fully support my<br/>
family back in Sri Lanka. I was able to help send my sister to college and support the education<br/>
of my nieces and nephew. I recently saved enough money to buy land in Sri Lanka, where I hope<br/>
to build my mom a more modern, safer home.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?Â </strong>People would never know<br/>
that I grew up in a remote village and didn't experience modern conveniences or technology<br/>
until I was grown. I didn't know how to use a real toilet or shower until I was 18 and moved<br/>
overseas (in Sri Lanka, we had a hole in the ground in an outhouse for a toilet and bathed in the<br/>
river behind the house). We washed our clothes in the river. I didn't get my driver's license (or<br/>
really drive a car) until my wife â then girlfriend â helped me get one in Dubai when I was 26.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> My mom is absolutely my hero. She has sacrificed everything for<br/>
her children. When I was young and my father was ill, she had to make the immensely difficult<br/>
decision to leave behind three young children to go work in a foreign country as a housemaid.<br/>
She suffered and was mistreated there, but she did what she had to do to keep us fed.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> I think I'm pretty original and not too<br/>
similar to anyone who has played before. I have some aspects of former players, like my jungle<br/>
skills and an engaging personality, but I think I'm unique and will bring something new and<br/>
refreshing to the game.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can win Survivor? </strong>I am a strong competitor. I have a unique and<br/>
engaging personality and believe my tribe would want to keep me because I can provide, win<br/>
challenges and keep them entertained. I will do whatever it takes to win. This game is so<br/>
important to me and winning it would be my greatest achievement. I have unique life<br/>
experiences that will help me to make it to the end.</div>"

<br/>
<strong>Pet Peeves:</strong> Being asked a question and the answer being ignored<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> I've always been willing to make a<br/>
change, pickup and go. It makes me feel brave to know I've changed my career when unhappy.<br/>
I've purchased a one- way plane ticket not knowing what to expect, just to audition to dance<br/>
around the country and succeeded. I've moved alone to new states on a whim. I only have this<br/>
one life, I don't want to waste it doing what's easy.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong>Â Â I am deaf in one ear. I focus<br/>
heavily on reading lips and am fluent in ASL.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> My husband, Andy.Â  He has navigated through life after many<br/>
setbacks, struggles and the tragic loss of a parent in a car accident.Â Andy focused on putting his<br/>
physical comfort behind his and my desire for our family to grow and carried our children as a<br/>
transgender man. I cannot think of a better human.Â <br/>
Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?Â Â Aubry Bracco, but win. :)Â <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can win Survivor? </strong>The ability to show kindness, but also not take<br/>
certain attacks and situations seriously feels like most players' downfall.Â  They succumb to the<br/>
emotions and get voted out.Â  I have awareness of my being while also being very observant of<br/>
others and loyal, but not to a fault.Â </div>"

<br/>
<strong>Pet Peeves:</strong> Loud chewing and chewing with an open mouth. Uncleanliness. Really<br/>
crude humor; manners go a long way.Â <br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> I got a summer internship at a company<br/>
my junior year of college and I had been dreaming of working at the company for years. When I<br/>
got there, they presented me with an engineering problem that they had three full-time senior<br/>
engineers working on before I got there for the summer. None of them had been able to figure<br/>
out this problem. I was there for 12 weeks and figured out the solution to this problem in 8<br/>
weeks, after having been told that they did not expect me to be able to figure it out. I am so<br/>
proud of this moment because not only did I prove everyone wrong, I also made a direct impact<br/>
on the lung cancer diagnostic device the project was for. I lost my grandfather to lung cancer, so<br/>
I am proud of myself for making a difference in this field.Â Â <br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong> I have so many layers. I<br/>
come off as super-sweet, but I am tough and have the biggest fighting spirit you will ever see. I<br/>
am absolutely a force to be reckoned with and I feel bad for the people who underestimate me.Â <br/>
No one who looks at me realizes how smart I am just by seeing me. I am young, but I have been<br/>
through some tough things in my life and have learned how to bounce back from adversity.Â <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why? </strong>My grandmother. She passed away in April 2020 from COVID<br/>
and she fought alone, and all the way to the end. She did not have an easy life at all.Â  She fought<br/>
for absolutely everything that was hers and never gave up. She also treated everyone with so<br/>
much love and kindness and never expected anything back from anyone. My grandmother's<br/>
ability to bounce back from hit after hit that life threw at her is so inspiring to me and all I want<br/>
to do with my life is be someone that she would be proud of.Â <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong>Â Kim Spradlin. SheÂ actually tookÂ the<br/>
time to get to know the other people, which made her more personable. She also used this to her<br/>
advantage because she knew exactly how to get into their heads. She made people feel like they<br/>
were the ones making the moves, successfully diverting the target from her back. Kim was also<br/>
so strong and kicked butt in immunity challenges, which IÂ definitely thinkÂ that I can also do on<br/>
the show.Â <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can win Survivor?</strong> I don't think there has ever been someone on the<br/>
show with the same physicality, intelligence and social awareness that I have. I love talking to<br/>
and bonding with people and in order to win Survivor, you have to know how to connect with<br/>
people on a human level. I am very good at reading a room and know when someone is lying to<br/>
me. I also have the physical strength and fighting spirit that I know will push me to never give<br/>
up and always give everything I have. I am incredibly tough, both mentally and physically, and I<br/>
believe I will thrive in the environment of the game. I'm not going to tell anyone IÂ went to<br/>
MITÂ and I think I will be underestimated, which I will use to my advantage. With my ability to<br/>
genuinely connect with people, brains and physical strength, I could definitely be the final<br/>
Survivor.Â </div>"

<br/>
3 Words to Describe You: Passionate, authentic, resilient<br/>
<br/>
Pet Peeves: Bad breath, second-hand embarrassment and slow talkers<br/>
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? The accomplishment that I am MOST<br/>
proud of is doing the hard work in therapy and confronting my demons, working through the<br/>
pain and the feelings of injustice, and then being willing to cultivate a relationship with those<br/>
who let me down when I was little.<br/>
<br/>
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I was in a gang.<br/>
<br/>
Who is your hero and why? My mom, because I saw her fight her demons until her dying<br/>
breath. She experienced so much pain in her life, and my childhood was dark, twisted and<br/>
complicated, but she was an extremely hard-working Italian woman. She always made sure I<br/>
had a roof over my head and lunch money in my pockets. She did the best she could and I'm<br/>
grateful. She gave me the best life she knew how and loved me with all the love she had in her.<br/>
She is my image of beauty and strength. Also, Xena: WarriorPrincess. Lucy Lawless taught me<br/>
so much about how to be a strong, assertive woman and how to stand up for yourself in a world<br/>
full of men. She was my childhood hero, posters all over my wall. I even had a Xena: Warrior<br/>
Princess-themed birthday partyâ¦last year.<br/>

Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? I think I am probably going to play<br/>
the game most like Kim; strategically and relationally like Tai when it comes to idols, but I got<br/>
some Parv in me too.<br/>
<br/>
Why do you believe you can win Survivor? I believe I have what it takes to win. I think living<br/>
on the streets, developing a strong work ethic, practicing excellence in all that I do and put out<br/>
into the world, having a high threshold for pain and suffering, endurance, perseverance, knowing<br/>
that nothing comes easily but everything must be earned and worked for, rigorous self-<br/>
examination, zero entitlement, trusting that self discipline is self love, believing in others and<br/>
making them feel capable of accomplishing anything, my interpersonal skills, my wit and my<br/>
grit, my reverence for God in others, my heart to serve, and an attitude of gratefulness and<br/>
celebration for the small wins all make me believe that I will be the final Survivor.Â </div>"

Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Natalie White. She was able to<br/>
assess her place on her tribe and in her alliance, while consciously nursing Russell's ego. Her<br/>
social awareness is something I admired.<br/>

awareness. I am athletic, but not some 6'2"" buff dude who will be threatening. I am not a<br/>

What is something we would never know from looking at you? I hate brushing my teeth<br/>

Who is your hero and why? My grandmother is my hero. My mother was her only child and<br/>
she so gracefully lived through her untimely passing. She was blind to top it all off, yet the<br/>
smartest and funniest person in the world. She always made me feel loved and she laughed with<br/>
me all the time. She was literally my alarm clock every morning until she died!<br/>

3 Words to Describe You: Independent, resilient, adventurous<br/>
<br/>
Pet Peeves: Laziness and cockiness, especially from people who like to bark orders<br/>
<br/>
What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? Nike Cross Nationals is the Super Bowl<br/>
of cross country, and I love that people were baffled that my high school team even qualified.<br/>
The conditions on race day were grim: the field was hilly, drenched, and oozing mud, the temp<br/>
was a bone-chilling 40Â°, it was pouring rain and clearly no place for a Florida boy. Everyone was<br/>
miserable but seeing the best of the best riddled with fear and intimidation, I felt a surge of<br/>
confidence. Despite predictions that we would flop, we placed top 10.<br/>
<br/>
What is something we would never know from looking at you? I love the pursuit of<br/>
knowledge and experience. I could spend hours discussing the genius of Richard Serra's<br/>
commission for the NYC IRS building, or how Mandarin enables the mind to think more<br/>
creatively, or the lab I just finished on rendering an image of the Crab Nebula using doppler shift<br/>

<br/>
Who is your hero and why? Undoubtedly my dad. That man sacrifices everything for his<br/>
family and especially for me to live out my exuberant adventures and ambitions. He served in<br/>
the Navy, Peace Corps and now serves as a prominent doctor in the Jacksonville community.<br/>
People adore him, most of all me. Above all, he lets me know he's proud of me and supports me<br/>
in any direction I want to take my life.<br/>

Which past Survivor will you play the game most like? Any of the pretty-boy-challenge-beast-<br/>
charmers, just take your pick: Jay, Joe, Devon. I think I'd play most like Jay, a fellow<br/>

bonds, charming all and secretly thinking hyper-strategically.<br/>
<br/>
Why do you believe you can win Survivor? I will be the final Survivor because I'm the jack-<br/>
of-all-trades and there's nothing in life that can stop me. If I'm not happy with my situation, I<br/>
change it and shape the world the way I want to see it. I form deep bonds in every social sphere<br/>
I encounter and live such a diverse life, there's no one I can't relate to and empathize with. I'm<br/>
disciplined and won't rest until the million is mine, and no matter what I won't get complacent or<br/>

<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> In order for me to win, I will need to lower my threat level from the get-go. The most natural way is to embrace my inner goofy, like Fabio. And then, obviously the winners I would model my game after are Yul and Todd.<br/>

<strong>Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor?</strong> I truthfully think the odds are against me. It is all going to be a matter of threat management. Iâm going to leave it all on the table. I will play my heart out because it will probably be the one shot I get â Iâve been waiting years, and I want no regrets. I canât promise you I will win, but I can promise you I will have fun and make the most of this opportunity. Cancer survivors donât go anything less than full throttle.</div>"

<br/>
<strong>Pet Peeve:</strong> Dishonest people<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> Becoming an All-American Track Runner. If you are or ever have been a competitive athlete, you know the dedication, sacrifice, sweat and tears it takes to succeed. Every time I question my ability to make something happen, I look back at the girl who ran track and remember I was, and still am, that person!Â <br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong> I have a fear of death. I come off as super confident and strong, which I am, but deep down, I do fear the end. I think it stems from losing some very important people in my life at a young age. However, this fear doesnât cripple me; it gives me the perspective to live every day to the fullest.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> My mom! As I get older, I understand how much she gave up in having me and my older sister before the age of 18. I never wanted for anything and that is because my mom worked multiple jobs to ensure that never happened. When my Pops died and left her with 5 kids, she kept going and got me into university with a full scholarship. She is the bomb dot com.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> Kelley Wentworth. She contributes to her team and sets up alliances while still being a competitor in the competitions.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor?</strong> I believe my personality, physical strength and ability to manipulate people to do what I want will help me get to the final. I am able to see where different personalities fit in my life and utilize them when it fits.</div>"

<br/>
<strong>Favorite Hobbies:</strong> Traveling to new cities and using their public transit system<br/>
to explore, bringing my dogs to dog parks, recreating all my favorite dishes from<br/>
scratch using recipes I find online.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>3 Words to Describe You:</strong> Aggressive, astute, and audacious.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Pet Peeve:</strong> I hate judgmental people. Looking down on someone for their lifestyle or choices because theyâre not the same choices you make is so stupid. I hate patronizing people who talk down to others. Oh, and I hate when people wear shoes in my house.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> Iâm the first person from my family to go to college and graduate. I bought my first home at 24. I paid off all my student loans ($40k) by age 26. I am the youngest associate director of analytics at my company, by age 27. Most importantly, Iâm mentoring my younger brother to ensure he surpasses me in all aspects. Watching him make strides in school and in his personal life is my greatest accomplishment.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong> People would never guess that I grew up in extreme poverty by looking at me now. My family and I have very comfortable lives today, but weâve had to hustle and fight for the past two decades to improve our socio-economic class. We started in a one-bedroom apartment, shared with another family. My parents both worked seven days a week to provide for us, so I was often left alone to fend for myself from the age of 8. I learned to survive and be resilient from a very young age. People donât see that now, but Iâll always cherish those tougher years. They made me strong.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> My mother is my hero. ClichÃ© answer, but itâs true. She came to the U.S. with my father and me as a 23-year-old refugee with no grasp of the English language and $40 in her pockets. I could only imagine how much courage that takes. She worked hard, took no breaks and was able to provide for me despite all the challenges she faced.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> I want to say Parvati, but Iâm not that hot nor charming. I will realistically be similar to Aubry. She was just a strategic mastermind. She understood social rankings and was able to strategize across very nuanced alliances. Sheâs also non-threating, similar to myself, so Iâll focus on keeping bigger physical and social threats around to ensure myself a shield. She was also not afraid to cross-alliance lines and work with people who could further her game. Donât rule anyone out.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor?</strong> I believe that I am a well-rounded individual with great logical sense, a strong ability to read social situations, amazing speaking abilities, and a strong desire to better my familyâs lives. There is no alternative besides coming home with a million-dollar check.</div>"

<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> Starting and running my own company.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong> I used to be a girl. Iâm covered in tattoos. Iâm a big softy when it comes to animals. Iâm a collector of hurt or abandoned animals.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> My mom. No question. She had grace until the end. Her faith was unmatched. She was an awesome person. Not just a mother, but as a whole. I could only strive to be half the person she was.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> Elaine! Biscuit all the way. She was hard-working, confident, resilient and played a hell of a mind game! You couldnât not like her.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor?</strong> I believe it will be mentally, physically, emotionally and socially the hardest thing Iâll ever tend to do. It will break me down and challenge every aspect of my being â but I know that I am a survivor in life, and this will just be another aspect I will crush.</div>"

<br/>
<strong>Pet Peeve:</strong> Arrogant people and those with a sense of entitlement<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> As a designer, my career has certainly taken hard hits during times of recession. In those times, I've never given up and have, at times, shifted gears to a new career path (i.e., I became a certified Pilates instructor following the 2008 recession). I am proud of every twist and turn I have adapted to and can confidently say I am a successful design leader today.Â <br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong> I know how to weld and build furniture out of metal. I worked in a metal shop for a year. Iâm crafty and good with my hands.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> My husband is my hero. He left Australia to follow his dream to live in New York with two suitcases and enough money to last a few months. Heâs not afraid to try something different and take risks. He saved me from settling in life and inspires me to always strive for more!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> Kelly Wentworthâs tenacity is definitely something I will emulate. I donât give up! Lauren Beck because she really studied and watched people to understand their motives. I love to study human behavior.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor?</strong> I have a high EQ (emotional intelligence). This means I know how to read people well and understand what they are feeling. Iâm also a great listener and leader and know I will be able to gain trust.</div>"

<strong>Occupation:</strong> Dietitian<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Favorite Hobbies:</strong> Co-ed flag football in the sand at Bar A by the shore. Interior decorating for the holidays. Any high intensity or adrenaline activity â snowboarding, paintballing, skydiving, wake surfing, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>3 Words to Describe You:</strong> Loud! Growing up, my friendsâ parents always described me as âthe loud friend.â Talkative â all of my report cards every year [said] âtalkativeâ or âdistracts others.â Intense personality â Iâm a good person, but I definitely do not mesh with everyone.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Pet Peeve:</strong> I hate wasted time. Anything that just eats away time drives me nuts. I have too much pent-up energy that I need to do something. I hate slow and quiet talkers. Spit it out and speak up! This is why New Jersey is my homeland and the only place people understand me. We are all cut from the same cloth.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> Becoming a dietitian and starting my own business. I never thought I would be in this position and be taking on this role. I surprised myself with what I am capable of, and I have more motivation than ever. I clearly can do much more than I thought, and now I want to see how far I can push myself. I run my own business, I conducted my first real interview and just hired a woman who could be my mom. I am literally now a BOSS! I gathered an accountant, payroll team, billing company, logo person, etc. My family is just as shocked as I am with what I managed to accomplish in such a short time frame. And we have been so successful! We have tripled our revenue in our second year and have been recognized nationally. My entire personality screams SURVIVOR. Now with this momentum under my belt, nothing is going to stop me. Watch out tribe!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong> I played tackle football. It was difficult being on a team where nobody wanted me there, including my coaches. My teammates would literally hit me harder than everyone else because I was a girl. Iâm not going to lie, it hurt a lot. But that wasnât going to stop me from playing and hitting harder back.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> I would have to say my younger sister. She graduated college to work in environmental law. She is super passionate about saving the environment and making the world safer for people. She is going to do great things. She is incredibly charming. She has this way about her that everyone immediately loves her. But she is also a very strong person. Not physically, but mentally. She does not back down from anyone or get intimidated. Even though she is my younger sister, I really look up to her. She has such great morals and is truly so caring and compassionate for others and always puts others first. She is awesome! She is just as big of a goofball as me.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> Lauren Beck. She is very self-aware, and I feel like she does a great job of assessing everyone elseâs strengths and weaknesses, which helps her have a very good handle on the social game and how to outwit the best out of everyone. At the end of the day, it doesnât matter how physically good you are at things. The social game dictates if you get voted out. This quality is the most important in my eyes.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor?</strong> I can definitely outwit everyone since I am very familiar with dealing with different types of people and have always had a strategic mind. I can read people very well and am very good at persuading others. Plus, letâs be real, people are stupid. And when people are hungry, they forget how to stay composed. Once you see the cracks, it gets easier to outwit. I can outplay everyone because I am very competitive and athletic so I should be one of the top competitors in challenges. Iâm an animal. I can outlast everyone because I have grit. I have always been able to endure difficult and uncomfortable situations when needed if I know there is a bigger outcome on the other side waiting for me. I donât break easily. I have too much determination to ever think to quit. I will be the final Survivor!</div>"

<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> Staying true to myself no matter the circumstance. Also, riding Mickeyâs Fun Wheel at Disneyland despite being afraid of Ferris wheels.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong> I am terrified of vacuum cleaners. I can use one, but I canât be in a room when someone else is vacuuming because people always chase me with it, and it scares me.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> Kristin Wiig. Sheâs so funny, adaptable, and paves the way for herself and writes.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> I think Tom Westman. He was honest, but still a great player. Also, Cirie. She is a great social player. Iâll carry my own in challenges but dominate socially. Maybe a little crazy like Debbie? Time will only tell.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor?</strong> I believe I could be the sole Survivor because Iâm likable, funny, but also wicked smart and strategic.

<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> Living my life as I believe I should; BEING the ME I like and respect. My teaching awards are pretty cool, too. Moms always feel like we need to say our kids are our proudest accomplishment â I think that goes without saying.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong> Well, perhaps because Iâm always in front of people in some sort of leadership role, everyone thinks I am super strong, have no problemsâ¦or never made a mistake. In reality, I am a bag of mistakes made and lessons learned. I am also tender-heartedâif someone else is hurt, I hurt. Basically, Iâm a softy.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> Kious Kelly. Kious was the first nurse in New York to die of COVID-19. He gave his life for others. He was a dearly loved and respected nurse. He passed on March 24, 2020. Kious was my brother.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> Ironically, a mix between Angelina and Tony. After Angelinaâs turbulent first few weeks, she slipped under the radar and made it to the end. Tony brought an upbeat, funny and light energy. By the time he was recognized as a threat, it was too late.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor?</strong> My greatest asset is my emotional intelligence and ability to accurately read people. My game will be easy to argue at the final three. I believe being likable and smart/savvy pays off in the end and secures the vote.</div>"

<strong>Favorite Hobbies:</strong> Tabletop / video games, reading and snowboarding<br/>
<br/>
<strong>3 Words to Describe You:</strong> Energetic, empathetic, and chaotic<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Pet Peeve:</strong> When people donât listen to me, people who walk slowly in front of me, anything that disrupts my sleep, hypocrites, and people who donât apologize.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> Writing an article for my school newspaper that led to me being invited to consult with my universityâs Equity and Inclusion officer on creating a better framework and support for Black students at McMaster University. Being able to use my voice for change that not only benefitted me was so empowering.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong> I am a great listener! Just because I talk a lot, it does not mean I am not listening. People are so used to hearing me when I am there, so when I am quiet, people usually donât think Iâm there and I can take notice on what they are saying. Also, I check in on people and let them vent to me, which gives me more context about them that can help guide my future decisions.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> My hero is my mother. She was born into poverty in a village in Kenya as the youngest of five. My mother is so hardworking and managed to get herself out of poverty and became a doctor in Kenya and was able to provide for her mom. She then gave that all up to support my fatherâs dreams, but then became a doctor in Canada while having three young children while dealing with the systemic racism in academic medicine. My mom sacrificed and worked so hard to give her family a better life and never faltered from her dreams. I aspire to be like her. She changed my life.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> Davie. Davie was someone who had loyalty to many people, had a strong core alliance and was social. Not only that but he was able to find idols and win challenges and play idols correctly to further his game. But most of all, Davie had so much fun when he was on the island, no matter if he was on the top or bottom of his tribe. Davie had the path to 6th place, and I will perfect it to 1st.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor?</strong> I believe I will win SURVIVOR because I am a social person, and SURVIVOR at its core is a numbers game. I have lived in diverse cities and also been in situations where I was the only black person. But in every situation, I thrived and SURVIVOR is another place where my resilience and personality will shine. Also, I never go down without a fight. When all hope is lost, I will be searching for idols, talking to people, and convincing them that me staying is best for everyone. I am going on SURVIVOR to win and I will do everything in my power to do so.</div>"

<br/>
<strong>Pet Peeve:</strong> People ripping open cereal boxes and leaving them open. People who are late.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> Easy! Raising my children! I know itâs clichÃ©, but itâs true. I come from the projects, not a very good home life, and I didnât know how to be a father. But I watched other good fathers, learned and raised two amazing kids and Iâm very proud.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong> Iâm sensitive. I care. I get my feelings hurt. Iâm smart (at least I think so). My heart hurts for the less fortunate. I love learning. Iâm a straight arrow.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> Not sure if I have any heroes, but I have people I looked up to and who taught me about life, how to be a father, a hard worker, honest, and loyal: Capt. Stankiswiez, John OâBrien, Aunt Ruth and Uncle David.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> I would love to play like Boston Rob. Not sure it will work out that way but I really believe that I have all the great attributes of all the great players.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor?</strong> I honestly think I can be the final Survivor because I possess all the attributes needed. Iâll be a beast in challenges, a worker in camp, yet Iâll make people believe Iâm not a threat until itâs too late. I also have the gift of gab! People will like me (even Jeff).</div>"

<strong>Favorite Hobbies:</strong> Training animals, Settlers of Catan, and watching TV<br/>

<strong>3 Words to Describe You:</strong> Silly, empathetic and shameless<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Pet Peeve:</strong> People who complain about the cost of vet care, rudeness, feeding seeds to parrots, gym grunters, Joey from âFriends,â the fact that mini wheats have gelatin, when people talk bad about pigeons, and institutional racism.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> Iâm most proud of setting my mind to become an exotic animal specialist from undergrad. It is more difficult to get into vet school than med school in Canada, and the avian/exotics residency has the lowest admission rate of any specialty (3-5%). Iâm also proud of maintaining my Muslim values while living in the Western world â abstaining from alcohol, pork and premarital sex â no matter how hard it may be. I am also proud of the resilience I didnât know I had within me to deal with my fatherâs death in 2017.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong> People would never know the difficult childhood I had financially and emotionally. We had very little money, living off my momâs disability support; there were times where our lights were cut, we were evicted, and there was little money for food. Given that level of instability, people would be surprised to realize how far Iâve been able to come. I still love both my parents very much, but I can also recognize their shortcomings. Their love for us was never a question to me, but I can reconcile that they are imperfect people who did the best they could, even though they fell short in some important ways. Also, Iâm afraid of condiments.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> Although my father had many shortcomings, heâs definitely someone I consider a hero. He had a tremendous amount of love for his children and even through some of his poor choices, that always shined through. He is missed every single day. I also admire my older sister very much because she often acted as a parent towards my younger sister and I but had no one to look up to herself. Sheâs always been there for us emotionally, financially, or with whatever we need. She has risen to be a top emergency psychiatrist in Toronto, and that work with mental health is so important.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> Rob Cesterninoâs strategic prowess â he really understood the power dynamics and when to shift the game, and also made people feel comfortable with humor. He was also able to articulate his game beautifully in confessional. Cirie Fields â her sit, wait, and strike strategy is savage. Tyson Apostol â his sass and strategic game. Kim Spradlin â her social skills were top notch, and she made an alliance with everyone, and wasnât afraid to make moves. Natalie Anderson for her laser focus.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor?</strong> âThey must adapt, or theyâll be voted out of the game.â A statement that has not changed. You can look to nature and Darwinâs theory of evolution and see how the fittest survive, but the fittest may not be the lion in every situation. My ability to adapt, connect with others, understanding strategy &amp; how to manipulate numbers, and most importantly â social awareness of myself and others are the key ingredients to success. I am not going to leave everything to starve on an island to let someone else win. I am playing for me and my family, and no one will get in the way of that. I canât wait to do the show I love so much proud, by not only winning but being the first Indian and Muslim to do so. It would be a dream come true to see my nieces watch me win and serve as a role model â that will never leave my mind.</div>"

<strong>3 Words to Describe You:</strong> Competitive, intuitive and smart<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Pet Peeve:</strong> I am a bit impatient, so I would say slow people, laziness and people who donât know how to read a room.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> Several. I always dreamed of working in the industry so I am. I dreamed of owning my own pageant, so I do. I dreamed of traveling the world, so I have. I always accomplish my goals.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong> How competitive I am. Because I am a small man, and gay and Latino, people always underestimate me. I love proving them wrong. I hate losing or being wrong. I always want to have the right answer and win everything I do.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> My mother and father. They are immigrants who came to this country with nothing. They wanted a better life for their family. Despite not knowing the language, they were able to build a home and offer me a better life than the one they had growing up.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> I donât think anyone has played a game like the one I will play. But I do want to achieve great SURVIVOR historical moments like Sandra, Cirie, Parvati, Rupert, Rob. I want to be remembered.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor?</strong> I know I can be the final Survivor because I am likable enough and persuasive enough to convince people to vote for me. I always find a way to get what I want.</div>"

<br/>
<strong>3 Words to Describe You:</strong> Competent, charismatic, caring<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Pet Peeve:</strong> People who have big dreams but donât work hard. People who are emotionally manipulative, or people who try to control me or tell me how to live my life.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> Getting into every college I applied to because I worked hard for that, writing and directing my own show and having a successful community response, and enlisting in the Army National Guard. I was raised to prioritize things like service to my country and the world. Iâm really proud of my decision to enlist.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong> Iâm a karate black belt. Just kidding. Itâs jujitsu. Just kidding. Probably nothing. I am very open and honest. I donât want my insecurities to feed into other peopleâs so I try to be as real as possible.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> Elon Musk. My lifeâs mission is to change the world for the better. Building something like Tesla, which is uber successful and also a boon to the environment, is my dream.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> A cross between Victoria Baamonde and Chaos Kass. Victoriaâs blindside of Aubrey is one of the most underappreciated moves ever, in my opinion, but she needed to take more control of her game, like Kass.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor?</strong> Having grown up in the most competitive environment in America, Iâve gotten pretty good at persuading people to cheerfully act in my best interests and not theirs. Recommendation letters, winning elections, high attendance for all my events, etc. -- my entire life has been a highly successful exercise in persuasion. It sounds awful, but to some extent, I live every day the way Tony plays.</div>"

<br/>
<strong>3 Words to Describe You:</strong> Quirky, warm, self-aware<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Pet Peeve:</strong> When people lack self-awareness, are emotionally reactive, immature, or petty<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> I graduated 100% debt-free from my undergraduate degree and paid for 50% of my masterâs degree by competing in pageants and by earning academic scholarships.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong> I get this all the time: âWhen I first met you, I thought you were going to be a mean girl, but now that I know you, thatâs not the case.â People tend to stereotype me, so theyâre surprised when they realize I have depth, am intelligent and that I do a lot of super nerdy things.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> It would be so cheesy to say âJesus,â but I did want to use this question to explain the importance of my faith. I am a fully devoted follower of Christ, and my life motto is to âlove God and love people.â I recognize that there is a higher calling on my life than simply living for myself.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> 100% Kim Spradlin. Not only was she a beast in challenges, but her social game was so strong. She developed genuine relationships with the other players, and almost everyone considered her a trustworthy ally, even if she didnât feel the same way about them. Her tribemates viewed her as a leader, and her alliance members followed her lead. She didnât go into the game trying to be super manipulative and deceptive. I felt like she tried to be as authentic as she could in a game like SURVIVOR.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor?</strong> I am the total package. I am a strong social player because of my background in counseling and psychology, so I understand human behavior. I genuinely care about people and know how to connect on a deeper, personal level. I am an animal when it comes to anything physical because of my strength, grit, and unrelenting determination. I have studied the game of SURVIVOR, so I know what strategy will work in the game. I come off as a very sweet, trustworthy person, but people have no idea what Iâm capable of. I know how to balance being a huge threat, while also drawing people in and making them want to work with me. My faith gives me an advantage because I can rely on God when I am weak and ask Him for guidance.</div>"

<strong>3 Words to Describe You:</strong> Clever, competitive and storyteller<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Pet Peeve:</strong> People who donât tip. I used to deliver pizza, so itâs a pretty big deal for me. My biggest one is when the bill is like $19.95, and the customer handed me a $20 smiling and said, âKeep the change.â Oh, really? I get to keep your nickel? Wow, thank you so much!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</strong> At the moment, thereâs a bunch of academic stuff, like getting into Washington University and winning the Tournament of Champions (the biggest tournament of the year in debate). But for personal accomplishments, Iâm really proud of this one sketch I wrote for our spring comedy show, titled âSkate Park.â There was no trophy or award or anything, but I worked extremely hard on it, and it absolutely killed. It was really rewarding.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What is something we would never know from looking at you?</strong> I think that a lot of people would assume because Iâm young, that Iâm naÃ¯ve or that I have no life experience. That couldnât be further from the truth. I am a hustler. Iâve worked hard for my grades, my scores and competitive success. I wanted to go to a top-tier school, so I worked hard to get in. I have worked hard for what I have, and Iâm proud of it.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Who is your hero and why?</strong> My parents. Theyâve supported me in every way imaginable and Iâm so unbelievably lucky to have them. When I was going through tough times, they were always there for me, and I just want to be able to repay them some day. And for non-family hero, Ethan Zohn. He was the first Jewish person I ever saw on TV, which was so insanely cool for 5-year-old me. And beyond that, heâs just such an inspirational person.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Which past Survivor will you play the game most like?</strong> Todd Herzog. He played a brilliant game in China, where he controlled every single vote from the shadows. Weâre in a period of SURVIVOR now where the tallest tree is the first one cut; just look at Edge of Extinctionâs boot order. You need to build a resume, but you canât let anyone realize how extensive your resume is until itâs too late. Todd managed to keep his threat-level low while subtly manipulating every facet of the game and revealed everything at Final Tribal Council. Iâd also love to mix that with Jeremyâs meat shield strategy, so that Iâm never the first one targeted if things go awry.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why do you believe you can be the Sole Survivor?</strong> I love all of the core skills that you need to win the game. Iâm extremely personable and make friends easily. Iâm super intelligent and strategic, with a vast knowledge of the game. Iâm athletic enough to not be a liability, but not enough to be a threat. And most importantly, I am willing to work harder than anyone to win. In speech and debate, I competed against hundreds of students from around the country every weekend. These people were just as smart as me, just as well-spoken and just as talented. But I beat them because I worked harder and because I wanted it more. And the same will be true for SURVIVOR.</div>"
